*      in the spitbol translator, the following conditional
*      assembly symbols are referred to. to incorporate the
*      features referred to, the minimal source should be
*      prefaced by suitable conditional assembly symbol
*      definitions.
*      in all cases it is permissible to default the definitions
*      in which case the additional features will be omitted
*      from the target code.
