*      -------------------------------
*
*
*      VERSION 3.6A TO 3.7 (NOVEMBER 1, 1991, MARK B. EMMER)
*      -----------------------------------------------------
*
*      BUGS FIXED
*      ----------
*
*      B3.701  ADD BTKWV AND REFINED TEST AT CDGVL+9 TO PREVENT
*              VARIABLE NAMES ALPHABET, LCASE, UCASE FROM BEING
*              PRE-EVALUATED BECAUSE OF THEIR ASSOCIATED
*              CONSTANT KEYWORDS.  THE CODE
*                 ALPHABET = "ABC"; OUTPUT = SIZE(ALPHABET)
*              RETURNED ZERO BECAUSE OF PRE-EVALUATION.
*      B3.702  DELAY BINDING TO FUNCTION BLOCK OF FOURTH
*              ARGUMENT TO TRACE FUNCTION.  THIS PERMITS THE
*              TRACE FUNCTION TO BE INVOKED BEFORE THE 4TH
*              ARGUMENT FUNCTION IS DEFINED.  ACCOMPLISHED BY
*              STORING A VRBLK POINTER IN TRFNC, AND FETCHING
*              ITS VRFNC ENTRY LATER, IN TRXEQ.
*      B3.703  REFERENCES TO KEYWORDS WITH CONSTANT PATTERN
*              VALUES (&ARB, &BAL, ETC.) DID NOT WORK.  A WTB
*              INSTRUCTION HAD BEEN OMITTED AT ACS14+2.
*      B3.704  IF A PROGRAM EMPLOYED THE CODE FUNCTION TO
*              REDEFINE A LABEL THAT WAS THE ENTRY LOCATION OF
*              A USER-DEFINED FUNCTION, THE FUNCTION WOULD
*              CONTINUE TO JUMP TO ITS OLD FUNCTION BODY.  PFCOD
*              IN PFBLK WAS POINTING DIRECTLY TO THE TARGET CODE
*              BLOCK, INSTEAD OF DOING SO INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE
*              VRBLK FOR THE ENTRY LABEL.
*      B3.705  THE TEST THAT REQUIRED A LABEL TO BE DEFINED
*              BEFORE IT COULD BE USED AS THE ENTRY OF A USER-
*              DEFINED FUNCTION HAS BEEN REMOVED.  FUNCTIONS
*              MAY BE DEFINED EVEN IF THE LABEL IS YET
*              UNDEFINED.
*      B3.706  AFTER A COMPILATION ERROR IN THE CODE FUNCTION,
*              THE EVAL FUNCTION PRODUCES SPURRIOUS ERRORS.  THE
*              CODE OFFSET CWCOF WAS NOT BEING RESET TO THE
*              BEGINNING OF CODE BLOCK.  ADD LINE AT ERR04+1 TO
*              ACCOMPLISH THIS RESET.
*      B3.707  INCONSISTANT TESTS WITH MXLEN CORRECTED.  SEVERAL
*              PLACES WERE TESTING WITH BGE INSTEAD OF BGT,
*              RESULTING IN SUCH ANOMALIES AS THE STATEMENT
*                 &MAXLNGTH = &MAXLNGTH
*              FAILING.  SINCE MXLEN IS GUARANTEED TO BE
*              STRICTLY LESS THAN DNAMB, IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO
*              CREATE OBJECTS OF SIZE MXLEN.  BGE CHANGED TO
*              BGT AT LOCATIONS
*                 S$ARR+14, SAR07+8, ALOBF+3, ASG14+8, GTAR6+10.
*      B3.708  EXIT(COMMAND STRING) WAS NOT LOADING PTR TO FCB
*              CHAIN INTO WB.  CORRECTED AT SEXT1.
*      B3.709  CHANGE PATST TO RETURN NON-STRING ERROR FOR NULL
*              ARGUMENT.  PREVIOUSLY, BREAK(), ANY(), ETC., WERE
*              SUCCEEDING, CONTRARY TO THE LANGUAGE DEFINITION.
*      B3.710  CONVERT FUNCTION WITH NULL SECOND ARGUMENT
*              CRASHED SYSTEM BY CALLING FLSTG WITH WA=0.  ADDED
*              TEST AT S$CNV, MOVED ERROR 74 TO SEPARATE ERB AT
*              SCV29.
*      B3.711  LEQ(,) CRASHED SYSTEM.  LCOMP DID NOT OBEY
*              MINIMAL ASSUMPTION THAT CMC OPCODE WILL ALWAYS
*              BE CALLED WITH WA .GT. 0.  ADDED TEST AT LCMP1.
*      B3.712  MODIFIED LINE AT SDF07+4 TO USE REGISTER WA
*              INSTEAD OF WB.  THIS CORRECTS PROBLEM OF DEFINE
*              FUNCTION WITH LOCAL VARIABLE LIST THAT BEGINS
*              WITH COMMA-  DEFINE("F(X),L1,L2")
*      B3.713  ERRONEOUS PLC ON UNINITIALISED R$CIM IN LISTR.
*      B3.714  ERRONEOUS CALL TO FLSTG POSSIBLE WITH NULL STRING
*              AT SDAT1.
*      B3.715  WHEN COPY FUNCTION USED WITH TABLE ARGUMENT, FIX
*              PROBLEM AT COP07.  WHEN COPYING FIRST TEBLK ON A
*              CHAIN, THE PSEUDO-PREVIOUS BLOCK POINTER IN XR
*              IS PUSHED ON THE STACK PRIOR TO CALLING ALLOC.
*              THIS IS NOT A VALID BLOCK POINTER, AS IT POINTS
*              WITHIN THE TBBLK.  IF THE SUBSEQUENT ALLOC
*              INVOKES GBCOL, THE HEAP BECOMES SCRAMBLED.
*              RECODED TO SAVE POINTER TO START OF BLOCK, PLUS
*              OFFSET IN WB.
*      B3.716  AT IOP01, IF GTVAR TRIGGERED GARBAGE COLLECTION
*              VIA ALOST, TRAP BLOCK IN WC WAS NOT COLLECTED.
*              SAVE WC ON STACK TO MAKE IT COLLECTABLE ACROSS
*              GTVAR CALL.
*      B3.717  AT ASG10, ALLOW CASE OF VARIABLE WITH MORE THAN
*              ONE TRBLK, AS HAPPENS WITH THE FOLLOWING STMT -
*              OUTPUT(.OUTPUT, .OUTPUT, FILENAME).
*      B3.718  AT SENF1, TRBLK CHAIN SEARCH WAS RELOADING CHAIN
*              HEAD, CAUSING INFINITE LOOP IF THE DESIRED TRBLK
*              WAS NOT THE FIRST ON CHAIN.  SYSTEM CRASHED WITH
*              TRACE(.V1) OUTPUT(.V2,.V1,FILE).
*      B3.719  PROTOTYPE STRINGS (DEFINE, LOAD, DATA, ETC.) WERE
*              ALLOWING BLANK CHARACTERS, PRODUCING BOGUS
*              VARIABLE NAMES.
*      B3.720  THE FACT THAT IOFCB DESTROYED REGISTER WC WAS NOT
*              DOCUMENTED.  B$EFC CONVERSION OF FILE ARGUMENT
*              NEVER WORKED BECAUSE WC AND XT WERE DESTROYED BY
*              CALL TO IOFCB.
*      B3.721  IOPUT LEFT A TRBLK ATTACHED TO FILEARG1 IF SYSIO
*              FAILED.  SUBSEQUENT USE OF THIS FILEARG1 VARIABLE
*              IN ANOTHER I/O CALL WOULD CRASH SYSTEM.
*      B3.722  ADD CHK AT EVLP1 TO CATCH RECURSIVE PATTERN ERROR.
*      B3.723  ALLOW -LINE TO WORK PROPERLY WITHIN CODE FUNCTION
*              BY SETTING CMPLN DIRECTLY IN CNC44.  IF FILE NAME
*              ABSENT, DECREMENT SCNPT TO RESCAN TERMINATOR.
*      B3.724  WHEN MXLEN EXCEEDS START OF DYNAMIC MEMORY, ROUND
*              IT UP TO MULTIPLE OF WORD SIZE PRIOR TO STORING
*              IN DNAMB AT INI06.
*      B3.725  PROVIDE RIGHT PADDING OF ZERO CHARACTERS TO ANY
*              STRING RETURNED BY AN EXTERNAL FUNCTION.
*      B3.726  RESET FLPTR AT BPF17 FOR UNDEFINED FUNCTION
*              WHEN EVALX IS EVALUATING AN EXPRESSION.
*      B3.727  MODIFY CODE AFTER READ5 FOR OUTER NESTING OF
*              AN EXECUTE-TIME COMPILE OF -INCLUDE STATEMENT.
*              CREATE A SUBSTRING OF REMAINDER OF ORIGINAL
*              CODE FUNCTION ARGUMENT STRING AND RETURN AS
*              RESULT OF READR FUNCTION
*      B3.728  THE DEFINITION OF THE AOV OPCODE IS CORRECTED.
*              FORMERLY THE DEFINITION SPECIFIED THAT THE BRANCH
*              WAS TO BE TAKEN IF THE RESULT OF THE ADDITION
*              EXCEEDED CFP$M, IMPLYING A TEST FOR OVERFLOW
*              FROM SIGNED ADDITION.
*              HOWEVER, ADDRESS ARITHMETIC MUST BE UNSIGNED TO
*              ALLOW FOR SYSTEMS WHERE THE HIGH ORDER ADDRESS
*              BIT IS SET.  THEREFORE, THE TEST MUST BE FOR
*              CARRY OUT OF THE HIGH ORDER BIT, IF THE RESULT
*              WOULD EXCEED CFP$L.
*      B3.729  A LABEL TRACE ON THE ENTRY LABEL FOR A FUNCTION
*              WAS UNDETECTED, RESULTING IN A TRANSFER TO
*              B$TRT AND SUBSEQUENT CRASH.  SEE BPF08 FOR FIX.
*      B3.730  POP FIRST ARGUMENT TO SUBSTR IF IT IS A BUFFER.
*      B3.731  PATTERN REPLACEMENT WITH BUFFER SUBJECT RETURNED
*              NULL STRING INSTEAD OF NEW SUBJECT VALUE.
*              CHANGED TO BEHAVE AS IF SUBJECT WAS A STRING.
*      B3.732  IF CONVERT FUNCTION WAS CALLED WITH A BUFFER
*              FIRST ARGUMENT AND "BUFFER" SECOND ARGUMENT,
*              IT WOULD CONVERT THE BUFFER TO A STRING, AND
*              THEN BACK TO A BUFFER.  THIS HAS BE CORRECTED
*              TO SIMPLY RETURN THE FIRST ARGUMENT AS THE
*              FUNCTION RESULT.
*      B3.733  DETECT EXTERNAL FUNCTION RETURNING A NULL STRING
*              UNCONVERTED RESULT AT BEF12, AND JUMP TO EXNUL.
*      B3.734  FIX PROBLEM AT INS04 WHEN INSERTING ZERO LENGTH
*              STRING INTO BUFFER.  DEFEND AGAINST INVOKING
*              MVC WITH A ZERO VALUE IN WA, WHICH WILL CAUSE
*              SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS TO WRAP THE COUNTER.
*      B3.735  ADD OVERFLOW TEST FOR COS AND SIN TO DETECT
*              OUT-OF-RANGE ARGUMENT.
*      B3.736  FIXED PROBLEM INTRODUCED WITH B3.727 NOT
*              RESTORING R$CIM, SCNPT AND SCNIL AFTER CREATING
*              SUBSTRING.
*      B3.737  FIXED TFIND TO PLACE DEFAULT VALUE IN NEWLY
*              ALLOCATED TEBLK.
*      B3.738  ADDED BL$P0 TO P$NTH ENTRY POINT.  THE EXPRESSION
*              DATATYPE(CONVERT("","PATTERN")) WOULD CRASH WHEN
*              THE DTYPE FUNCTION USES THE NON-EXISTANT TYPE
*              WORD PRECEDING P$NTH.
*      B3.739  BUG AT GTN35 IN THE CASE OF OVERFLOW DURING CVM.
*              WB CAN BE DESTROYED BY CVM ON SOME PLATFORMS.
*      B3.740  PROTECT SCONTINUE FROM USAGE IN OTHER THAN ERROR
*              320 CASE.
*      B3.741  PROTECT CONTINUE FROM USAGE FOLLOWING ERROR
*              EVALUATING COMPLEX FAILURE GOTO.
*
*
*      CHANGES
*      -------
*
*      C3.701  ADD .CULK CONDITIONAL TO INCLUDE &LCASE, &UCASE.
*      C3.702  ADD -LINE NN "FILENAME" CONTROL CARD.
*      C3.703  MOVE .CNLD CONDITIONAL UP IN ROUTINE DFFNC TO
*              OMIT ALL TESTS FOR B$EFC.
*      C3.704  ADD CONDITIONAL .CICC TO IGNORE UNRECOGNIZED
*              CONTROL CARDS.
*      C3.705  ADD CONDITIONAL .CNSC TO OMIT STRING TO NUMERIC
*              CONVERSION IN SORT.  THE PRESENCE OF THIS
*              CONVERSION MODE PRODUCES A SORT RESULT THAT IS
*              DEPENDENT UPON THE ORDER OF INPUT DATA.
*              FOR EXAMPLE, GIVEN INPUT DATA "2", 5, "10",
*              STRING COMPARISON YIELDS "10" LT "2", BUT STRING
*              TO INTEGER CONVERSION YIELDS "2" LT 5 LT "10".
*      C3.706  ADD SEVENTH RETURN FROM SYSHS THAT ALLOWS CALLEE
*              TO RETURN A STRING POINTER AND LENGTH.  THIS IS
*              DONE TO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THE CALLER TO HAVE
*              AN SCBLK BIG ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE LONG STRINGS.
*      C3.707  ADD EIGHTH RETURN FROM SYSHS TO FORCE COPY OF
*              BLOCK POINTED TO BY XR.
*      C3.708  MADE -COPY A SYNONYM FOR -INCLUDE.
*      C3.709  ADD CONDITIONAL .CBYT FOR STATISTICS DISPLAYED
*              IN BYTES RATHER THAN WORDS.
*      C3.710  DUMP NULL VALUED VARIABLES WHEN DUMP = 3.  CORE
*              DUMP PRODUCED FOR DUMP = 4.
*      C3.711  RESTRICT MINIMUM VALUE TO WHICH KEYWORD MAXLNGTH
*              CAN BE SET TO 1,024 VIA NEW VARIABLE MNLEN.
*      C3.712  ADD CONDITIONAL SYMBOL .CMTH FOR EXTENDED MATH
*              FUNCTIONS- ATAN, CHOP, COS, EXP, LN, SIN, SQRT,
*              TAN.  X**Y AND REMDR(X,Y) ARE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE
*              REALS.
*      C3.713  ADD BIT TO SYSPP TO SET -PRINT UPON ENTRY
*      C3.714  ADD CONDITIONAL .CSFN TO TRACK SOURCE FILE NAME
*              ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CODE BLOCK.
*      C3.715  ADD CONDITIONAL .CINC FOR -INCLUDE CONTROL CARD
*              FEATURE.  THE FORMAT OF THE CARD IS
*                 -INCLUDE "FILENAME"
*              INCLUDE CONTROL CARDS MAY BE USED DURING BOTH THE
*              INITIAL COMPILE AND EXECUTE-TIME COMPILE.  THE
*              FILENAME IS SAVED IN A TABLE, AND REDUNDANT
*              INCLUDES OF THAT FILE ARE IGNORED.
*      C3.716  ADD CONDITIONAL .CSLN TO INCLUDE SOURCE LINE
*              NUMBER IN CODE BLOCKS.  RELEASE CURRENT CCBLK
*              AFTER INITIAL COMPILE.
*      C3.717  CHANGED RILEN TO 258 (FROM 120) TO PROVIDE
*              UNIFORM INPUT LINE LENGTH WHEN READING FROM
*              TERMINAL OR INPUT.
*      C3.718  ADD ADDITIONAL EXIT TO IOFCB TO DISTINGUISH
*              ARGUMENT NOT CONVERTABLE TO STRING AND ARGUMENT
*              FILE NOT OPEN.
*      C3.719  ADD FOURTH AND FIFTH ARGUMENTS TO HOST FUNCTION.
*      C3.720  ADD &COMPARE KEYWORD TO CONTROL STRING
*              COMPARISONS.
*      C3.721  SETUP PFDMP AT INIY0 IN CASE OSINT FORCED
*              &PROFILE NON-ZERO.
*      C3.722  ADD CONDITIONAL SYMBOL .CAEX TO INCLUDE UP ARROW
*              AS SYNONYM FOR EXPONENTIATION.
*      C3.723  ADD CONDITIONAL .CCMC AND EXTERNAL FUNCTION SYSCM
*              TO PROVIDE STRING COMPARISON USING COLLATION
*              SEQUENCE OTHER THAN STRICT ORDERING OF CHARACTER
*              CODES (INTERNATIONAL COMPARES).
*      C3.724  ADD CONDITIONAL .CPOL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTION SYSPL
*              TO PROVIDE INTERACTIVE CONTROL OF SPITBOL
*              EXECUTION.
*      C3.725  ADD CONDITIONAL SYMBOL .CERA AND EXTERNAL
*              FUNCTION SYSEA TO PROVIDE ADVICE OF COMPILATION
*              AND RUNTIME ERRORS TO OSINT.
*      C3.726  ADD CMPLN, RDCLN, RDNLN TO TRACK SOURCE LINE
*              NUMBER.
*      C3.727  CONVERTED ERROR MESSAGES TO UPPER/LOWER CASE.
*      C3.728  ADD CONDITIONAL .CGBC TO EXTERNAL ROUTINE SYSGC.
*              CALLED AT THE START AND END OF GARBAGE COLLECTION
*              TO PERFORM ANY NEEDED NOTIFICATION TO OPERATING
*              SYSTEM OR USER.
*      C3.729  MODIFIED LAST LINE OF S$SET FROM EXNUL TO EXINT
*              SO SEEK CAN RETURN FINAL FILE POSITION AFTER
*              SEEK.
*      C3.730  PLACE MOV XR,(XS) AT S$RMD+4 TO ALLOW REAL SECOND
*              ARG TO REMDR.
*      C3.731  REMOVE REDUNDANT BGE XR,=CFP$U,SCN07 AT SCN06+4
*      C3.732  CHANGE DEFINITION OF CMC AND TRC SUCH THAT ONLY
*              XL MUST BE CLEARED AFTER OPERATION.  NOTE, THIS
*              CHANGE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY VOIDED.  CMC AND TRC MUST
*              CLEAR BOTH XL AND XR, BECAUSE UTILITY ROUTINES
*              MAY PRESERVE XL OR XR ON THE STACK, AND THE STACK
*              IS COLLECTABLE BY GBCOL.
*      C3.733  REMOVE MOST BRANCHES TO EXITS AND EXIXR.
*              INSTEAD, JUMP DIRECTLY TO NEXT CODE WORD.
*      C3.734  ADD ERROR 260 FOR ARRAY TOO LARGE IN GTARR.
*      C3.735  ADD CONDITIONAL .CS32 TO INITIALIZE STLIM TO
*              2147483647.
*      C3.736  ADD SECOND ARGUMENT TO EXIT FUNCTION, ALLOWING
*              USER TO SPECIFY FILE NAME OF LOAD MODULE BEING
*              WRITTEN.  IF OMITTED, OSINT WILL PROVIDE A
*              DEFAULT NAME.
*      C3.737  ADD CONDITIONAL .CSPR TO INCLUDE SPARE LOCATIONS
*              IN WORKING AREA.  THESE MAY BE USED IN LATER BUG
*              FIXES WITHOUT CHANGING THE SIZE OF THE WORKING
*              STORAGE AND OBSOLETING MODULES CREATED BY EXIT().
*              SUBSUENTLY REMOVED IN C3.767.
*      C3.738  ADD R$CTS TO REMEMBER LAST STRING USED TO BUILD
*              BIT COLUMN IN PATST.
*      C3.739  CHANGE FLSTG TO TYPE E PROCEDURE INSTEAD OF R.
*      C3.740  STANDARDIZE ON BIG-ENDIAN SYSTEMS.  AT THE
*              IMPLEMENTORS CHOICE, THE ZGB OPCODE CAN ALSO
*              PERFORM A BYTE SWAP IF NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE BIG-
*              ENDIAN BYTE ORDERING.  THIS IS DONE SO THAT
*              SYSTEMS WITH SIMILAR WORD LENGTHS WILL PRODUCE
*              THE SAME HASH CODE FOR STRINGS, AND HENCE THE
*              SAME ORDERING FOR TABLE ENTRIES.  THE HASHS
*              PROCEDURE HAS AN ADDITIONAL ZGB ADDED TO REORDER
*              THE LENGTH WORD.
*      C3.741  ADD CONDITIONAL .CSOU TO CAUSE ASSIGNMENTS TO
*              OUTPUT AND TERMINAL VARIABLES TO BE PROCESSED
*              THROUGH CALLS TO SYSOU RATHER THAN THROUGH
*              LISTING BUFFER.  DONE TO ELIMINATE SHORT RECORD
*              LENGTHS ENFORCED BY BUFFER SIZE.  A CODE OF 0 OR
*              1 IS PASSED TO SYSOU INSTEAD OF AN FCBLK.
*      C3.742  INCREASED INILN, INILS, RILEN TO 1024.
*      C3.743  ADD BIT TO SYSPP TO SET NOERRORS MODE.
*      C3.744  ADD .CCMK CONDITIONAL TO INCLUDE KEYWORD COMPARE
*              EVEN IF SYSCM IS NOT BEING INCLUDED.  DONE TO
*              PROVIDE IDENTICAL DATA REGIONS IN SYSTEMS THAT
*              IMPLEMENT SYSCM AND THOSE WHICH DO NOT, SO THAT
*              SAVE FILES CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE NEXT RELEASE.
*      C3.745  ADD WC RETURN PARAMETER TO SYSIL TO ALLOW
*              INTERFACE TO INFORM SPITBOL IF FILE ABOUT TO BE
*              READ IS A BINARY FILE.  IF SO, NO BLANK TRIMMING
*              OCCURS.
*      C3.746  FOLD LOAD FUNCTION ARGUMENT TYPES TO UPPER CASE.
*      C3.747  ADD .CEXP CONDITIONAL TO HAVE SYSEX POP ITS
*              ARGUMENTS.
*      C3.748  IN STOPR, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DISPLAY FILE NAME AND
*              LINE NUMBER IF STOPPING BECAUSE OF STACK OVERFLOW
*              DURING GARBAGE COLLECTION.  POINTERS TO FILE NAME
*              TABLE AND CODE BLOCK ARE WRONG.
*      C3.749  ADD BIT TO SYSPP TO SET CASE FOLDING MODE.
*      C3.750  ADD ADDITIONAL RETURN FROM SYSLD IF INSUFFICIENT
*              MEMORY TO LOAD/CALL EXTERNAL FUNCTION.
*      C3.751  ADD ADDITIONAL RETURNS FROM SYSEX IF INSUFFICIENT
*              MEMORY OR BAD ARGUMENT TYPE.
*      C3.752  IGNORE LEADING AND TRAILING BLANKS IN ARGUMENTS
*              WITHIN PROTOTYPE STRINGS TO CLEAR, DATA, DEFINE
*              AND LOAD.
*      C3.753  TEST FOR FATAL ERROR AT ERR04 AND ABORT IF SO.
*              FORCE TERMINATION ON STACK OVERFLOW BY SETTING
*              ERRFT TO 4 IN STACK OVERFLOW SECTION.
*      C3.754  RECODE COPY LOOP AT SRT14 TO EXCHANGE USAGE OF
*              REGISTERS XL AND XR.  THIS PERMITS USE OF THE
*              MVW ORDER INSTEAD OF THE EXPLICIT LOOP CODING
*              PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED.
*      C3.755  ADD .CENG CONDITIONAL TO INCLUDE ROUTINES NEEDED
*              BY TEXT PROCESSING ENGINE. ADD ROUTINES ENEVS AND
*              ENGTS FOR USE BY ENGINE OR DEBUGGER.  COPY XR TO
*              XL AROUND CALL TO SYSPL TO ALLOW SYSPL TO
*              TRIGGER GARBAGE COLLECTION.
*      C3.756  ADD &FILE, &LASTFILE, &LINE, &LASTLINE KEYWORDS.
*              FOR NOW, LINE AND LASTLINE ARE MAINTAINED IN THE
*              SAME MANNER AS STNO AND LASTNO, WHICH ADDS OVER-
*              HEAD TO THE STATEMENT INITIALIZATION CODE.  A
*              POSSIBLE CHANGE IS TO CREATE A STMLN PROCEDURE
*              THAT MAPS STATEMENT NUMBERS TO LINE NUMBERS.
*              ONE SIMPLE STRATEGY WOULD BE TO SWEEP CODE BLOCKS
*              IN MEMORY LOOKING FOR THE STATEMENT NUMBER AND
*              EXTRACTING THE LINE NUMBER FROM THAT CODE BLOCK.
*              SUCH A PROCEDURE WOULD ALSO ALLOW LINE NUMBERS
*              (AND FILE NAMES) TO BE ADDED TO STATEMENT PROFILE
*              REPORTS.
*      C3.757  CHANGE SORT TO FAIL INSTEAD OF PRODUCING ERROR
*              MESSAGE IF ARGUMENT TABLE IS NULL.  CHANGE SORTA
*              TO RETURN FAILURE.  ADD ANOTHER RETURN TO GTARR
*              TO DISTINGUISH NULL TABLE FROM BAD ARGUMENT.
*      C3.758  CREATE PROCEDURE PRTMM TO DISPLAY MEMORY USAGE
*              STATISTICS, AND CALL IT WHEN PRODUCING END-OF-
*              RUN STATS.
*      C3.759  ADD LABEL SCONTINUE TO ALLOW SETEXIT TO RESUME
*              EXECUTION EXACTLY WHERE IT WAS INTERRUPTED.
*      C3.760  ADD SNOBOL4 BACKSPACE FUNCTION AND CONDITIONAL
*              .CBSP.
*      C3.761  ADD ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS TO SYSGC TO ASSIST
*              VIRTUAL MEMORY MANAGERS.
*      C3.762  THE METHOD OF CONVERTING A TABLE TO AN ARRAY HAS
*              BEEN REVISED.  PREVIOUSLY, TABLE ELEMENTS WERE
*              COPIED TO THE RESULT ARRAY IN THE ORDER THEY WERE
*              ENCOUNTERED ALONG THE VARIOUS HASH CHAINS.  THIS
*              APPEARED TO THE USER AS A RANDOM ORDERING.  HOW-
*              EVER, SPITBOL/370 AS WELL AS SIL SNOBOL4 ORDERED
*              ARRAY ELEMENTS ACCORDING TO THEIR TIME OF ENTRY
*              INTO THE TABLE.  USER PROGRAMS THAT RELIED UPON
*              THIS BEHAVIOR MALFUNCTIONED WHEN PORTED TO MACRO
*              SPITBOL.
*              TO REMEDY THIS, THE CONVERSION IS PERFORMED IN
*              THREE STEPS:
*              1. CONVERT TABLE TO AN ARRAY PLACING THE ADDRESS
*                 OF EACH TEBLK IN THE ARRAY INSTEAD OF THE KEY
*                 AND VALUE.
*              2. SORT THE ARRAY OF ADDRESSES.  THIS ORDERS ELE-
*                 MENTS BY TIME OF CREATION (ASCENDING ADDRESS).
*              3. SCAN THE ARRAY, REPLACING ADDRESSES WITH THE
*                 KEY AND VALUE FROM THE REFERENCED TEBLK.
*              THE AFFECTED PORTIONS OF THE PROGRAM ARE AT S$CNV
*              AND IN GTARR, WHICH NOW ACCEPTS AN ADDITIONAL
*              ARGUMENT SPECIFYING WHETHER TO PLACE KEY/VALUES
*              IN THE ARRAY OR TEBLK ADDRESSES.
*      C3.763  IF CASE-FOLDING IS ACTIVE, FOLD THE FUNCTION NAME
*              PROVIDED TO THE LOAD() FUNCTION BEFORE PASSING IT
*              TO SYSLD.
*      C3.764  ADD SEDIMENT ALGORITHM TO GARBAGE COLLECTOR,
*              CONDITIONED ON .CSED.
*      C3.765  ADD OPTIMIZATION TO DISCARD NULL STATEMENTS AND
*              STATEMENTS WHICH JUST HAVE A CONSTANT SUBJECT
*              (SEE CODE AT CMP12).
*      C3.766  REARRANGED ORDER OF INITIAL OBJECTS IN STATIC
*              MEMORY SO THAT HASH TABLE IS THE LAST OF THE FOUR
*              OBJECT CREATED BY INITIALIZATION CODE.  THIS IS
*              DONE SO THAT THE PRINT BUFFER, GTS WORK AREA, AND
*              &ALPHABET KEYWORDS DO NOT NEED TO BE SAVED IN
*              ANY SAVE FILE CREATED BY OSINT.  ADDED ROUTINE TO
*              INITIALIZE THESE STRUCTURES.
*      C3.767  REMOVED .CSPR CONDITIONAL AND SPARE LOCATIONS.
*      C3.768  ADDED .CREL CONDITIONAL AND EXTENSIVE ROUTINES
*              (RELOC ET. AL.) TO PERFORM RELOCATION OF DATA
*              IN WORKING SECTION, STATIC REGION, AND DYNAMIC
*              REGION AFTER RELOAD OF A SAVED MEMORY IMAGE.
*              ROUTINES RELAJ, RELCR, AND RELOC ARE INVOKED
*              BY OSINT AFTER RELOADING A SAVE FILE.
*              IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO RELOAD SUCH AN IMAGE EVEN
*              IF THE SPITBOL COMPILER AND ITS DATA STRUCTURES
*              ARE RELOADED TO OTHER ADDRESSES.  THE WORKING
*              SECTION HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY REARRANGED TO
*              ACCOMMODATE THE RELOC PROCEDURE.
*      C3.769  ZERO R$CCB (INTERIM CCBLK PTR) IN COLLECT,
*              CONVERT, EVAL, AND EXIT FUNCTIONS TO RELEASE
*              UNNEEDED CCBLK MEMORY.
*      C3.770  ADD EXIT(4) AND EXIT(-4) TO ALLOW EXECUTION TO
*              CONTINUE AFTER WRITING SAVE FILE OR LOAD MODULE.
*              REVISED SYSXI INTERFACE TO DETECT CONTINUATION
*              AFTER PERFORMANCE OF EXIT(4) OR EXIT(-4) ACTION.
*      C3.771  CHANGE FILNM TO PRESERVE REGISTERS.
*      C3.772  ADDITION OF .CNCR AND SYSCR (REAL TO STRING
*              SYSTEM ROUTINE OPTION).
*      C3.773  MODIFIED REPLACE FUNCTION TO OPTIMIZE USAGE
*              WHEN SECOND ARGUMENT IS &ALPHABET.  IN THIS CASE,
*              THE THIRD ARGUMENT CAN BE USED AS THE TRANSLATE
*              TABLE DIRECTLY.
*      C3.774  MODIFIED CONDITIONALS FOR BUFFERS AND REALS SO
*              THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE BLOCK CODES ARE ALWAYS
*              PRESENT, EVEN IF THESE DATA TYPES ARE CONDITIONED
*              OUT.  THIS PROVIDES CONSISTENT BLOCK CODE
*              NUMBERING FOR EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS.
*      C3.775  MODIFIED ALOBF TO TEST STRING LENGTH AGAINST
*              KVMXL INSTEAD OF MXLEN.  ALSO, ALOBF WAS TESTING
*              TOTAL SIZE OF BFBLK, INSTEAD OF JUST STRING LEN.
*      C3.776  MOVE UTILITY ROUTINES SOURCE UP TO LIE BETWEEN
*              PREDEFINED SNOBOL FUNCTIONS (S$XXX) ROUTINES AND
*              UTILITY PROCEDURES.  THIS WAS DONE TO ASSIST
*              TRANSLATION ON PLATFORMS SUCH AS APPLE MACINTOSH
*              THAT USE 15-BIT OFFSETS TO STORE ERROR EXITS (PPM
*              BRANCHES).  OFFSETS TO LABELS LIKE EXFAL WERE
*              JUST TOO FAR AWAY.  SIMILARLY, FUNCTIONS TFIND,
*              TMAKE, AND VMAKE ARE LOCATED OUT OF ALPHABETIC
*              ORDER TO SATISFY THE MACINTOSH'S LIMITED RANGE
*              FOR SUBROUTINE CALLS.  MOVE BUILT-IN LABELS
*              BEYOND THE BLOCK AND PATTERN ROUTINES TO GET IT
*              WITHIN 32K OF THE ERROR ROUTINES.
*      C3.777  AT SCN46, ALLOW COLON, RIGHT PAREN AND RIGHT
*              BRACKET TO TERMINATE = OPERATOR WITH DEFAULT
*              NULL OPERAND.
*      C3.778  ADDED .CTET CONDITIONAL FOR TABLE ENTRY TRACE.
*      C3.779  INTRODUCE CFP$L, THE LARGEST UNSIGNED VALUE
*              THAT MAY BE STORED IN A ONE-WORD INTEGER.  THIS
*              IS DONE TO ACCOMMODATE MACHINES WHERE MEMORY
*              ADDRESSES HAVE THE HIGH-ORDER ADDRESS BIT SET.
*      C3.780  PERFORM REPLACE IN PLACE IF FIRST ARG IS BUFFER.
*      C3.781  PERFORM REVERSE IN PLACE IF FIRST ARG IS BUFFER.
*      C3.782  CHANGE SYSOU TO ACCEPT BUFFER AS WELL AS STRING
*              TO BE OUTPUT.  CHANGE CODE AT ASG11 TO PREVENT
*              CONVERSION OF BUFFER TO STRING.
*      C3.783  OPTIMIZE POS AND RPOS WHEN IT IS THE FIRST NODE
*              OF A PATTERN AND HAS EITHER AN INTEGER OR SIMPLE
*              EXPRESSION VARIABLE ARGUMENT.  IF UNANCHORED MODE
*              AND THE CURSOR IS ZERO, IT IS ADVANCED DIRECTLY
*              TO THE DESIRED CURSOR POSITION.
*      C3.784  PERFORM TRIM FUNCTION IN PLACE IF ARG IS BUFFER.
*      C3.785  ADD GTSTB PROCEDURE TO GET A STRING OR BUFFER
*              ARGUMENT FOR REPLACE, REVERSE, SIZE, TRIM, ETC.
*      C3.786  CHANGE LEQ, LGT, ETC. TO PERFORM COMPARISONS
*              WITHOUT CONVERTING BUFFER ARGUMENTS TO STRINGS.
*              THIS IS DONE BY CHANGING LCOMP TO ACCEPT BUFFER
*              ARGUMENT(S).  THIS ALSO AFFECTS SORT FUNCTION,
*              WHICH WILL COMPARE TWO BUFFERS AS STRINGS.
*      C3.787  CHANGE GTNUM TO USE CHARACTERS IN BUFFER WITHOUT
*              CONVERSION TO A STRING.  THIS IMPLIES THAT ACOMP
*              WILL PERFORM ARITHMETIC COMPARISONS OF BUFFERS
*              WITHOUT CONVERTING TO STRINGS FIRST.
*      C3.788  PERFORM COMPARISONS OF STRINGS AND BUFFERS IN
*              SORTC.
*      C3.789  CHANGE INSBF TO ALLOW INSERTION OF A BUFFER INTO
*              A BUFFER WITHOUT FIRST CONVERTING IT TO A STRING.
*              NOTE THAT THIS ONLY WORKS WHEN THE TWO BUFFERS
*              ARE NOT THE SAME.
*      C3.790  DOCUMENTATION CHANGE:  NOTE THAT ALL OF THE BLOCK
*              MOVE OPCODES SHOULD HAVE WA .GT. 0.  NOT ALL
*              IMPLEMENTATIONS AVOID MOVING OBJECTS WHEN WA IS
*              ZERO.
*      C3.791  CHANGE IDENT TO PROVIDE BUFFER/BUFFER AND
*              BUFFER/STRING COMPARISONS, TO ACCOMMODATE USERS
*              WHO PERFORM IDENT(BUF) TO CHECK FOR NULL STRING
*              IN BUFFER.
*      C3.792  ADDED FULLSCAN KEYWORD INITIALIZED TO ONE.  USER
*              MAY SET TO ANY NON-ZERO VALUE, WILL RECEIVE AN
*              ERROR MESSAGE IF ATTEMPTS TO SET TO ZERO, SINCE
*              QUICKSCAN MODE IS NOT SUPPORTED.
*      C3.793  REWROTE STATEMENT STARTUP CODE AT STMGO TO ONLY
*              PERFORM CHECKING OF PROFILING, STCOUNT TRACING,
*              AND STATEMENT COUNTING IF NECESSARY.
*      C3.794  ADD ADDITIONAL EXIT TO SYSFC AND IOPUT TO SIGNAL
*              THAT I/O CHANNEL (FCBLK) IS ALREADY IN USE.
*              ADDED ERROR MESSAGE NUMBERS 289 AND 290.
*      C3.795  ADDED OPTIONAL INTEGER ARGUMENT TO DATE FUNCTION
*              TO SPECIFY FORMAT OF DATE STRING RETURNED BY
*              SYSDT.

*      VERSION 3.6 TO 3.6A (OCT 83)
*      ---------------------------
*
*      CHANGES
*      -------
*
*      C3.617  ADD .CNLF. IF DEFINED, THEN ARGUMENTS TO EXTERNAL
*              FUNCTIONS MAY BE DECLARED TO HAVE TYPE FILE.
*              SUCH ARGUMENTS MUST HAVE BEEN USED AS SECOND
*              ARG TO INPUT() OR OUTPUT() AND A POINTER TO THE
*              FCB IS PASSED TO THE EXTERNAL FUNCTION.
*
*
*      VERSION 3.5 TO 3.6 (JUN 83)
*      ---------------------------
*
*      CODES USED TO IDENTIFY AUTHORS ARE (SGD) FOR DUFF,
*      (REG) FOR  GOLDBERG, AND (LDS) FOR SHIELDS.
*
*      BUGS FIXED
*      ----------
*      B3.601  (SGD) TO FIX MULTIPLE TRAP BLOCK PROBLEM IN ASIGN
*      B3.602  (SGD) PATCH IN GTARR TO FIX NULL CONVERT.
*      B3.603  (SGD) INSERTED MISSING WTB AFTER SYSMM CALLS.
*      B3.604  (SGD) USE STRING LENGTH IN HASHS.
*      B3.605  (SGD) FIXED SERIOUS PARSER PROBLEM
*              RELATING TO (X Y) ON LINE BEING VIEWED AS PATTERN
*              MATCH.  FIXED BY ADDITION OF NEW CMTYP VALUE
*              C$CNP (CONCATENATION - NOT PATTERN MATCH).
*      B3.606  (SGD) FIXED EXIT(N) RESPECIFICATION CODE
*              TO PROPERLY OBSERVE HEADER SEMANTICS ON RETURN.
*      B3.607  (SGD) BYPASS PRTPG CALL AT INITIALIZATION
*              FOLLOWING COMPILATION IF NO OUTPUT GENERATED.
*              THIS PREVENTS OUTPUT FILES CONSISTING OF THE
*              HEADERS AND A FEW BLANK LINES WHEN THERE IS NO
*              SOURCE LISTING AND NO COMPILATION STATS.
*              ALSO FIX TIMSX INITIALIZATION IN SAME CODE.
*      B3.608  (SGD) B$EFC CODE DID NOT CHECK FOR
*              UNCONVERTED RESULT RETURNING NULL STRING.
*      B3.609  (SGD) LOAD PFVBL FIELD IN RETRN FOR
*              RETURN TRACING. THIS WAS CAUSING BUG ON RETURN
*              TRACES THAT TRIED TO ACCESS THE VARIABLE NAME.
*      B3.610  (SGD) FIXED PROBLEM RELATING TO COMPILATION OF
*              GOTO FIELDS CONTAINING SMALL INTEGERS
*              (IN CONST SEC).
*      B3.611  (REG) PREVENT CLEAR() FROM CLOBBERING PROTECTED
*              VARIABLES AT LABEL SCLR5.
*      B3.612  (REG) FIXED GTEXP FROM ACCEPTING TRAILING
*              SEMICOLON OR COLON. THIS IS NOT A LEGAL WAY
*              TO END AN EXPRESSION.
*      B3.613  (REG) FIXED DIFFICULTIES WITH LISTINGS DURING
*              EXECUTION WHEN NO LISTING GENERATED DURING
*              COMPILATION. -LIST TO CODE() CAUSED BOMB.
*              FIX IS TO RESET R$TTL AND R$STL TO NULLS NOT 0
*              AFTER COMPILATION.
*              (LISTR AND LISTT EXPECT NULLS)
*              WHEN LISTING AND STATISTICS ROUTED TO DIFFERENT
*              FILE THAN EXECUTION OUTPUT, ERROR MESSAGE IS SENT
*              TO EXECUTION OUTPUT (AND GETS SEPARATED FROM
*              ... IN STATEMENT ... MSG). LABO1 CALLS SYSAX AND
*              STOPR DOES NOT CALL SYSAX IF ENTERED FROM LABO1.
*      B3.614  (LDS) FIX MISUSE OF WC JUST AFTER ASG10.
*      B3.615  (LDS) ADD COMMENT POINTING OUT SUSPICIOUS CODE
*              AFTER TFN02
*      B3.616  (LDS) FIX INCONSISTENT DECLARATION OF SORTH.
*      B3.617  (LDS) INSERT MISSING CONDITIONAL TESTS ON CNBF.
*      B3.618  (LDS) FIX SOME VIOLATIONS OF MINIMAL LANGUAGE
*              THAT HAD SLIPPED PAST SOME TRANSLATORS.
*      B3.619  (LDS) CORRECT ERROR INTRODUCED IN FIXING B3.614.
       EJC
*      CHANGES
*      -------
*
*
*      C3.601  (SGD) ADDITION OF .CNCI AND SYSCI (INT TO STRING
*              SYSTEM ROUTINE OPTION)
*      C3.602  (REG) CHANGED INILN AND AND INILS TO 258
*      C3.603  (SGD) MERGED IN PROFILER PATCHES, REPAIRED CODE.
*      C3.604  (SGD) ADDED BUFFER TYPE AND SYMBOL CNBF
*      C3.605  (SGD) ADDED CHAR FUNCTION.  CHAR(N) RETURNS NTH
*              CHARACTER OF HOST MACHINE CHARACTER SET.
*      C3.606  (REG) ADDED CFP$U TO EASE TRANSLATION ON SMALLER
*              SYSTEMS - CONDITIONAL .CUCF
*      C3.607  (REG) ADDED LOWER CASE SUPPORT, CONDITIONAL .CULC
*      C3.608  (REG) ADDED SET I/O FUNCTION, CONDITIONAL .CUST
*      C3.609  (REG) CONDITIONALIZED PAGE EJECT AFTER CALL TO
*              SYSBX AND ADDED ANOTHER BEFORE CALL TO SYSBX,
*              SO THAT, IF DESIRED BY THE IMPLEMENTOR,
*              STANDARD OUTPUT WILL REFLECT ASSIGNMENTS MADE
*              BY EXECUTING PROGRAM ONLY.
*              CONDITIONAL .CUEJ CONTROLS - IF DEFINED THEN
*              EJECT IS BEFORE CALL TO SYSBX.
*      C3.610  (LDS) INTRODUCE .CTMD TO SUPPORT SYSTM THAT
*              REPORTS ELAPSED TIME IN DECISECONDS INSTEAD OF
*              MILLISECONDS.
*      C3.611  (LDS)  PROVIDE PLACE FOR .DEF OR .UND FOR EACH
*              CONDITIONAL  OPTION, SO THAT SETTINGS CAN BE
*              CHANGED WITHOUT CHANGING LINE NUMBERS.
*              CURRENT SETTINGS ARE FOR 808X TRANSLATION.
*      C3.612  (LDS) OBEY (NEW) RESTRICTION THAT OPERAND IN
*              CONDITIONAL BRANCH INSTRUCTION CANNOT HAVE FORM
*              (X)+ IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY TRANSLATIONS FOR WHICH
*              POSTINCREMENT NOT READILY AVAILABLE.
*      C3.613  (REG,LDS) ADD OP
*                    FLC WREG
*              THAT FOLDS CHARACTER IN WREG TO UPPER CASE.

*      SNOBOL4 IMPLEMENTORS MEETING HELD AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
*      IN AUGUST 1977. THEY ARE AIMED AT

*           (2) PRODUCING A STABLE DEFINITION OF MINIMAL BY
*           CARRYING OUT A FEW ESSENTIAL REVISIONS IN THE LIGHT
*           OF EXPERIENCE IN ITS USE.
*
*      CHANGES TO SPITBOL
*      ------------------
*
*      C3.201  DEFAULT VALUES FOR KEYWORDS TRIM AND ANCHOR ARE
*              ZERO. ON SYSTEMS WHERE RECORDS ARE CUSTOMARILY

*              STATEMENT FAILURE IF SYSIO USES THE FILE NOT
*              FOUND RETURN.
*              THE THIRD ARGUMENT HAS A RECOMMENDED FORMAT AND
*              TO OVERRIDE ITS DEFAULT DELIMITER (,) A
*              CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY SYMBOL, .CIOD, IS USED.
*              INTERFACES TO SYSEF,SYSEJ,SYFC,SYSIO,SYSRW
*              ARE REVISED.
*              WC MAY NOW BE USED TO RETURN FROM SYSIO, A MAX
*              RECORD LENGTH.
*      C3.204  A NEW CONFIGURATION PARAMETER CFP$F (SCBLK OFFSET
*              IS INTRODUCED. CFP$U IS REMOVED.

*      C3.206  ROUTINE SYSMX RETURNS THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF
*              SPITBOL OBJECTS (STRINGS ARRAYS ETC).  THIS
*              INFORMATION IS NOT NOW NEEDED AT TIME OF ENTRY TO
*              SPITBOL AND HENCE WC SHOULD BE ZERO ON ENTRY.
*      C3.207  A CONDITIONAL PARAMETER .CNRA PERMITS ASSEMBLY
*              OF A MORE COMPACT VERSION WITH NO REAL
*              ARITHMETIC CODE.
*      C3.208  TERMINAL IS A NEW PRE-ASSOCIATED VARIABLE

*              PLACED ON A LOCAL STACK IF DESIRED.
*      C3.225  OPCODE MNZ COMPLEMENTS ZER. IT MOVES A NON-ZERO
*              FLAG TO ITS DESTINATION.
*      C3.226  FOR SOME MACHINES IT IS PREFERABLE FOR THE STACK
*              TO BUILD UP RATHER THAN DOWN. TO PERMIT THIS
*              WITHOUT NEED FOR MASSIVE CHANGES IN MINIMAL AND
*              RECODING OF EXISTING PROGRAMS, A SCHEME HAS BEEN
*              DEVISED IN WHICH AN ADDITIONAL REGISTER NAME, XT,

*              WHERE THE ORDER IN WHICH THE DEFINITIONS ARE
*              SUPPLIED BY THE TRANSLATOR SHOULD MATCH THE
*              ORDER OF OCCURRENCE IN THE DEFINITIONS SECTION.
*      C3.230  THE FORMAT OF ERR,ERB OPCODES IS CHANGED TO
*              REQUIRE A NUMERIC OPERAND.
*      C3.231  THE RTN OPCODE IS USED TO INTRODUCE ROUTINES
*              (WHICH ARE QUITE DISTINCT FROM PROCEDURES).
*      C3.232  CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY DIRECTIVES MAY BE NESTED.

*      SECTION 2 - MEMORY
*
*      MEMORY IS ORGANIZED INTO WORDS WHICH EACH CONTAIN CFP$B
*      BYTES. FOR WORD MACHINES CFP$B, WHICH IS A CONFIGURATION
*      PARAMETER, MAY BE ONE IN WHICH CASE WORDS AND BYTES ARE
*      IDENTICAL. TO EACH WORD CORRESPONDS AN ADDRESS WHICH IS
*      A NON-NEGATIVE QUANTITY WHICH IS A MULTIPLE OF CFP$B.
*      DATA IS ORGANIZED INTO WORDS AS FOLLOWS.
*
*      1)   A SIGNED INTEGER VALUE OCCUPIES CFP$I CONSECUTIVE
*           WORDS (CFP$I IS A CONFIGURATION PARAMETER).
*           THE RANGE MAY INCLUDE MORE NEGATIVE NUMBERS THAN
*           POSITIVE (E.G. THE TWOS COMPLEMENT REPRESENTATION).
*
*      2)   A SIGNED REAL VALUE OCCUPIES CFP$R CONSECUTIVE
*           WORDS. (CFP$R IS A CONFIGURATION PARAMETER).
*
*      3)   CFP$C CHARACTERS MAY BE STORED IN A SINGLE WORD
*           (CFP$C IS A CONFIGURATION PARAMETER).
*
*      4)   A BIT STRING CONTAINING CFP$N BITS CAN BE STORED IN
*           A SINGLE WORD (CFP$N IS A CONFIGURATION PARAMETER).
*
*      5)   A WORD CAN CONTAIN A UNSIGNED INTEGER VALUE IN
*           THE RANGE (0 LE N LE CFP$L). THESE INTEGER VALUES
*           MAY REPRESENT ADDRESSES OF OTHER WORDS AND SOME OF
*           THE INSTRUCTIONS USE THIS FACT TO PROVIDE INDEXING
*           AND INDIRECTION FACILITIES.
*
*      6)   PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS OCCUPY WORDS IN AN UNDEFINED
*           MANNER. DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION,
*           INSTRUCTIONS MAY OCCUPY SEVERAL WORDS, OR PART OF
*           A WORD, OR EVEN BE SPLIT OVER WORD BOUNDARIES.

*
*      SECTION 3 - REGISTERS
*
*      THERE ARE THREE INDEX REGISTERS CALLED XR,XL,XS. IN
*      ADDITION XL MAY SOMETIMES BE REFERRED TO BY THE ALIAS
*      OF XT - SEE SECTION 4. ANY OF THE ABOVE REGISTERS
*      MAY HOLD A POSITIVE UNSIGNED INTEGER IN THE RANGE
*      (0 LE N LE CFP$L). WHEN THE INDEX REGISTER IS USED FOR
*      INDEXING PURPOSES, THIS MUST BE AN APPROPRIATE ADDRESS.
*      XS IS SPECIAL IN THAT IT IS USED TO POINT TO THE TOP
*      ITEM OF A STACK IN MEMORY. THE STACK MAY BUILD UP OR
*      DOWN IN MEMORY.SINCE IT IS REQUIRED THAT XS POINTS TO THE
*      STACK TOP BUT ACCESS TO ITEMS BELOW THE TOP IS PERMITTED,
*      REGISTERS XS AND XT MAY BE USED WITH SUITABLE OFFSETS
*      TO INDEX STACKED ITEMS. ONLY XS AND XT MAY BE USED FOR
*      THIS PURPOSE SINCE THE DIRECTION OF THE OFFSET IS
*      TARGET MACHINE DEPENDENT. XT IS A SYNONYM FOR XL
*      WHICH THEREFORE CANNOT BE USED IN CODE SEQUENCES
*      REFERENCING XT.
*
*      THE STACK IS USED FOR S-R LINKAGE AND TEMPORARY
*      DATA STORAGE FOR WHICH THE STACK ARRANGEMENT IS SUITABLE.
*      XR,XL CAN ALSO CONTAIN A CHARACTER POINTER IN CONJUNCTION
*      WITH THE CHARACTER INSTRUCTIONS (SEE DESCRIPTION OF PLC).
       EJC
*
*      THERE ARE THREE WORK REGISTERS CALLED WA,WB,WC WHICH
*      CAN CONTAIN ANY DATA ITEM WHICH CAN BE STORED IN A
*      SINGLE MEMORY WORD. IN FACT, THE WORK REGISTERS ARE JUST
*      LIKE MEMORY LOCATIONS EXCEPT THAT THEY HAVE NO ADDRESSES
*      AND ARE REFERENCED IN A SPECIAL WAY BY THE INSTRUCTIONS.
*
*      NOTE THAT REGISTERS WA,WB HAVE SPECIAL USES IN CONNECTION
*      WITH THE CVD, CVM, MVC, MVW, MWB, CMC, TRC INSTRUCTIONS.
*
*      REGISTER WC MAY OVERLAP THE INTEGER ACCUMULATOR (IA) IN
*      SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS. THUS ANY OPERATION CHANGING THE
*      VALUE IN WC LEAVES (IA) UNDEFINED AND VICE VERSA
*      EXCEPT AS NOTED IN THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTION ON SIMPLE
*      DUMP/RESTORE OPERATIONS.
*
*          RESTRICTION
*          -----------
*
*      IF IA AND WC OVERLAP THEN
*          STI  IASAV
*          LDI  IASAV
*      DOES NOT CHANGE WC, AND
*          MOV  WC,WCSAV
*          MOV  WCSAV,WC
*      DOES NOT CHANGE IA.
*
*
*
*      THERE IS AN INTEGER ACCUMULATOR (IA) WHICH IS CAPABLE OF
*      HOLDING A SIGNED INTEGER VALUE (CFP$I WORDS LONG).
*      REGISTER WC MAY OVERLAP THE INTEGER ACCUMULATOR (IA) IN
*      SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS. THUS ANY OPERATION CHANGING THE
*      VALUE IN WC LEAVES (IA) UNDEFINED AND VICE VERSA
*      EXCEPT AS NOTED IN THE ABOVE RESTRICTION ON SIMPLE
*      DUMP/RESTORE OPERATIONS.
*
*
*
*      THERE IS A SINGLE REAL ACCUMULATOR (RA) WHICH CAN HOLD
*      ANY REAL VALUE AND IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM ANY OF
*      THE OTHER REGISTERS OR PROGRAM ACCESSIBLE LOCATIONS.
*
*
*
*      THE CODE POINTER REGISTER (CP) IS A SPECIAL INDEX
*      REGISTER FOR USE IN IMPLEMENTATIONS OF INTERPRETORS.
*      IT IS USED TO CONTAIN A PSEUDO-CODE POINTER AND CAN
*      ONLY BE AFFECTED BY ICP, LCP, SCP AND LCW INSTRUCTIONS.
       EJC
*      SECTION 4 - THE STACK
*
*      THE FOLLOWING NOTES ARE TO GUIDE BOTH IMPLEMENTORS OF
*      SYSTEMS WRITTEN IN MINIMAL AND MINIMAL PROGRAMMERS IN
*      DEALING WITH STACK MANIPULATION. IMPLEMENTATION OF A
*      DOWNWARDS BUILDING STACK IS EASIEST AND IN GENERAL IS
*      TO BE PREFERRED, IN WHICH CASE IT IS MERELY NECESSARY TO
*      CONSIDER XT AS AN ALTERNATIVE NAME FOR XL.
*
*      THE MINIMAL VIRTUAL MACHINE INCLUDES A STACK AND HAS
*      OPERAND FORMATS -(XS) AND (XS)+ FOR PUSHING AND POPPING
*      ITEMS WITH AN IMPLICATION THAT THE STACK BUILDS DOWN IN
*      MEMORY (A D-STACK). HOWEVER ON SOME TARGET MACHINES IT IS
*      BETTER FOR THE STACK TO BUILD UP (A U-STACK).
*      A STACK ADDRESSED ONLY BY PUSH AND POP OPERATIONS CAN
*      BUILD IN EITHER DIRECTION WITH NO COMPLICATION BUT
*      SUCH A PURE SCHEME OF STACK ACCESS PROVES RESTRICTIVE.
*      HENCE IT IS PERMITTED TO ACCESS BURIED ITEMS USING AN
*      INTEGER OFFSET PAST THE INDEX REGISTER POINTING TO THE
*      STACK TOP. ON TARGET MACHINES THIS OFFSET WILL BE
*      POSITIVE/NEGATIVE FOR D-STACKS/U-STACKS AND THIS MUST
*      BE ALLOWED FOR IN THE TRANSLATION.
*      A FURTHER RESTRICTION IS THAT AT NO TIME MAY AN ITEM BE
*      PLACED ABOVE THE STACK TOP. FOR SOME OPERATIONS THIS
*      MAKES IT CONVENIENT TO ADVANCE THE STACK POINTER AND THEN
*      ADDRESS ITEMS BELOW IT USING A SECOND INDEX REGISTER.
*      THE PROBLEM OF SIGNED OFFSETS PAST SUCH A REGISTER THEN
*      ARISES. TO DISTINGUISH STACK OFFSETS, WHICH IN SOME
*      IMPLEMENTATIONS MAY BE NEGATIVE, FROM NON-STACK OFFSETS
*      WHICH ARE INVARIABLY POSITIVE, XT, AN ALIAS OR
*      SYNONYM FOR XL IS USED. FOR A U-STACK IMPLEMENTATION, THE
*      MINIMAL TRANSLATOR SHOULD NEGATE THE SIGN OF OFFSETS
*      APPLIED TO BOTH (XS) AND (XT).
*      PROGRAMMERS SHOULD NOTE THAT SINCE XT IS NOT A
*      SEPARATE REGISTER, XL SHOULD NOT BE USED IN CODE WHERE
*      XT IS REFERENCED. OTHER MODIFICATIONS NEEDED IN U-STACK
*      TRANSLATIONS ARE IN THE ADD, SUB, ICA, DCA OPCODES
*      APPLIED TO XS, XT. FOR EXAMPLE
*
*      MINIMAL           D-STACK TRANS.  U-STACK TRANS.
*
*      MOV  WA,-(XS)     SBI  XS,1       ADI  XS,1
*                        STO  WA,(XS)    STO  WA,(XS)
*      MOV  (XT)+,WC     LOD  WC,(XL)    LOD  WC,(XL)
*                        ADI  XL,1       SBI  XL,1
*      ADD  =SEVEN,XS    ADI  XS,7       SBI  XS,7
*      MOV  2(XT),WA     LOD  WA,2(XL)   LOD  WA,-2(XL)
*      ICA  XS           ADI  XS,1       SBI  XS,1
*
*      NOTE THAT FORMS SUCH AS
*      MOV  -(XS),WA
*      ADD  WA,(XS)+
*      ARE ILLEGAL, SINCE THEY ASSUME INFORMATION STORAGE
*      ABOVE THE STACK TOP.

*      SECTION 5 - INTERNAL CHARACTER SET

*      SECTION 6 - CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY FEATURES
*
*      SOME FEATURES OF THE INTERPRETER ARE APPLICABLE TO ONLY
*      CERTAIN TARGET MACHINES. THEY MAY BE INCORPORATED OR
*      OMITTED BY USE OF CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY. THE FULL
*      FORM OF A CONDITION IS -
*      .IF    CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY SYMBOL    (CAS)
*      .THEN
*             MINIMAL STATEMENTS1   (MS1)
*      .ELSE
*             MINIMAL STATEMENTS2   (MS2)
*      .FI
*      THE FOLLOWING RULES APPLY
*      1.   THE DIRECTIVES .IF, .THEN, .ELSE, .FI MUST
*           START IN COLUMN 1.
*      2.   THE CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY SYMBOL MUST START WITH A
*           DOT IN COLUMN 8 FOLLOWED BY 4 LETTERS OR DIGITS E.G.
*              .CA$1
*      3.   .THEN IS REDUNDANT AND MAY BE OMITTED IF WISHED.
*      4.   MS1, MS2 ARE ARBITRARY SEQUENCES OF MINIMAL
*           STATEMENTS EITHER OF WHICH MAY BE NULL OR MAY
*           CONTAIN FURTHER CONDITIONS.
*      5.   IF MS2 IS OMITTED, .ELSE MAY ALSO BE OMITTED.
*      6.   .FI IS REQUIRED.
*      7.   CONDITIONS MAY BE NESTED TO A DEPTH DETERMINED
*           BY THE TRANSLATOR (NOT LESS THAN 20, SAY).
*
*      SELECTION OF THE ALTERNATIVES MS1, MS2 IS BY MEANS OF THE
*      DEFINE AND UNDEFINE DIRECTIVES OF FORM -
*      .DEF   CAS
*      .UNDEF CAS
*      WHICH OBEY RULES 1. AND 2. ABOVE AND MAY OCCUR AT ANY
*      POINT IN A MINIMAL PROGRAM, INCLUDING WITHIN A CONDITION.
*      MULTIPLY DEFINING A SYMBOL IS AN ERROR.
*      UNDEFINING A SYMBOL WHICH IS NOT DEFINED IS NOT AN ERROR.
*
*      THE EFFECT IS THAT IF A SYMBOL IS CURRENTLY DEFINED,
*      THEN IN ANY CONDITION DEPENDING ON IT, MS1 WILL BE
*      PROCESSED AND MS2 OMITTED. CONVERSELY IF IT IS UNDEFINED,
*      MS1 WILL BE OMITTED AND MS2 PROCESSED.
*
*      NESTING OF CONDITIONS IS SUCH THAT CONDITIONS
*      IN A SECTION NOT SELECTED FOR PROCESSING MUST NOT BE
*      EVALUATED. NESTED CONDITIONS MUST REMEMBER THEIR
*      ENVIRONMENT WHILST BEING PROCESSED. EFFECTIVELY THIS
*      IMPLIES USE OF A SCHEME BASED ON A STACK WITH .IF, .FI
*      MATCHING BY THE CONDITION PROCESSOR OF THE TRANSLATOR.

*      THE LISTED POSSIBILITIES
*
*      VAL  01,02                      PREDEFINED VALUE
*
*           VAL IS USED TO REFER TO A PREDEFINED ONE WORD

*
*      REG  07,08                      REGISTER
*
*           REG IS USED TO DESCRIBE AN OPERAND WHICH CAN BE
*           ANY OF THE REGISTERS (XL,XR,XS,XT,WA,WB,WC). SUCH
*           AN OPERAND CAN HOLD A ONE WORD INTEGER (ADDRESS).
*
*      OPC  09,10,11                   CHARACTER
*
*           OPC IS USED TO DESIGNATE A SPECIFIC CHARACTER
*           OPERAND FOR USE IN THE LCH AND SCH INSTRUCTIONS.
*           THE INDEX REGISTER REFERENCED MUST BE EITHER XR OR
*           XL (NOT XS,XT). SEE SECTION ON CHARACTER OPERATIONS.
*
*      OPS  03,04,09,12,13,14,15       MEMORY REFERENCE
*
*           OPS IS USED TO DESCRIBE AN OPERAND WHICH IS IN
*           MEMORY. THE OPERAND MAY BE ONE OR MORE WORDS LONG
*           DEPENDING ON THE DATA TYPE. IN THE CASE OF MULTIWORD
*           OPERANDS, THE ADDRESS GIVEN IS THE FIRST WORD.
*
*      OPW  AS FOR OPS + 08,10,11      FULL WORD
*
*           OPW IS USED TO REFER TO AN OPERAND WHOSE CAPACITY IS
*           THAT OF A FULL MEMORY WORD. OPW INCLUDES ALL THE
*           POSSIBILITIES FOR OPS (THE REFERENCED WORD IS USED)
*           PLUS THE USE OF ONE OF THE THREE WORK REGISTERS
*           (WA,WB,WC). IN ADDITION, THE FORMATS (X)+ AND -(X)
*           ALLOW INDEXED OPERATIONS IN WHICH THE INDEX REGISTER
*           IS POPPED BY ONE WORD AFTER THE REFERENCE (X)+,
*           OR PUSHED BY ONE WORD BEFORE THE REFERENCE -(X)
*           THESE LATTER TWO FORMATS PROVIDE A FACILITY FOR
*           MANIPULATION OF STACKS. THE FORMAT DOES NOT IMPLY
*           A PARTICULAR DIRECTION IN WHICH STACKS MUST BUILD -
*           IT IS USED FOR COMPACTNESS. NOTE THAT THERE IS A
*           RESTRICTION WHICH DISALLOWS AN INSTRUCTION TO USE
*           AN INDEX REGISTER IN ONE OF THESE FORMATS
*           IN SOME OTHER MANNER IN THE SAME INSTRUCTION.
*           E.G.   MOV  XL,(XL)+   IS ILLEGAL.
*           THE FORMATS -(X) AND (X)+ MAY ALSO BE USED IN
*           PRE-DECREMENTATION, POST-INCREMENTATION TO ACCESS
*           THE ADJACENT CHARACTER OF A STRING.

*
*      OPN  AS FOR OPW + 07            ONE WORD INTEGER
*
*           OPN IS USED TO REPRESENT AN OPERAND LOCATION WHICH
*           CAN CONTAIN A ONE WORD INTEGER (E.G. AN ADDRESS).
*           THIS INCLUDES ALL THE POSSIBILITIES FOR OPW PLUS
*           THE USE OF ONE OF THE INDEX REGISTERS (XL,XR,XT,
*           XS). THE RANGE OF INTEGER VALUES IS 0 LE N LE CFP$L.
*
*      OPV  AS FOR OPN + 18-22         ONE WORD INTEGER VALUE
*
*           OPV IS USED FOR AN OPERAND WHICH CAN YIELD A ONE
*           WORD INTEGER VALUE (E.G. AN ADDRESS). IT INCLUDES
*           ALL THE POSSIBILITIES FOR OPN (THE CURRENT VALUE OF
*           THE LOCATION IS USED) PLUS THE USE OF LITERALS. NOTE
*           THAT ALTHOUGH THE LITERAL FORMATS ARE DESCRIBED IN
*           TERMS OF A REFERENCE TO A LOCATION CONTAINING AN
*           ADDRESS CONSTANT, THIS LOCATION MAY NOT ACTUALLY
*           EXIST IN SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS SINCE ONLY THE VALUE
*           IS REQUIRED. A RESTRICTION IS PLACED ON LITERALS
*           WHICH MAY CONSIST ONLY OF DEFINED SYMBOLS AND
*           CERTAIN LABELS. CONSEQUENTLY SMALL INTEGERS TO BE
*           USED AS LITERALS MUST BE PRE-DEFINED, A DISCIPLINE
*           AIDING PROGRAM MAINTENANCE AND REVISION.

*           DYNAMICALLY SHOULD BE RIGHT PADDED WITH ZERO
*           CHARACTERS TO A FULL WORD BOUNDARY TO PERMIT EASY

*
*           THE INTEGER ACCUMULATOR, WHICH IS ZERO OR NEGATIVE,
*           IS MULTIPLIED BY 10. WB CONTAINS THE CHARACTER
*           CODE FOR A DIGIT. THE VALUE OF THIS DIGIT IS THEN
*           SUBTRACTED FROM THE RESULT. IF THE RESULT IS OUT OF
*           RANGE, THEN CONTROL IS PASSED TO PLBL WITH THE
*           RESULT IN (IA) UNDEFINED. EXECUTION OF CVM LEAVES
*           THE RESULT IN (WB) UNDEFINED.
*
*      8.10 CVD              CONVERT BY DIVISION
*
*           THE INTEGER ACCUMULATOR, WHICH IS ZERO OR NEGATIVE,
*           IS DIVIDED BY 10. THE QUOTIENT (ZERO OR NEGATIVE)
*           IS REPLACED IN THE ACCUMULATOR. THE REMAINDER IS
*           CONVERTED TO THE CHARACTER CODE OF A DIGIT AND
*           PLACED IN WA. FOR EXAMPLE, AN OPERAND OF -523 GIVES
*           A QUOTIENT OF -52 AND A REMAINDER IN WA OF CH$D3.

*      PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED, IT IS USED BY THE JSR AND EXI
*      INSTRUCTIONS AND MAY BE USED FOR STORAGE OF ANY OTHER
*      DATA AS REQUIRED.
*
*      THE STACK BUILDS EITHER WAY IN MEMORY AND AN IMPORTANT
*      RESTRICTION IS THAT THE VALUE IN (XS) MUST BE THE ADDRESS
*      OF THE STACK FRONT AT ALL TIMES SINCE
*      SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS MAY RANDOMLY DESTROY STACK LOCATIONS
*      BEYOND (XS).
*
*      THE STARTING STACK BASE ADDRESS IS PASSED
*      IN (XS) AT THE START OF EXECUTION. DURING EXECUTION IT
*      IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STACK DOES NOT
*      OVERFLOW. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY EXECUTING THE FOLLOWING
*      INSTRUCTION PERIODICALLY.
*
*      10.1 CHK              CHECK STACK OVERFLOW
*
*      AFTER SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTING CHK, IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO
*      USE UP TO 100 ADDITIONAL WORDS BEFORE ISSUING ANOTHER CHK
*      THUS CHK NEED NOT BE ISSUED EVERY TIME THE STACK IS
*      EXPANDED. IN SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS, THE CHECKING MAY BE
*      AUTOMATIC AND CHK WILL HAVE NO EFFECT. FOLLOWING THE
*      ABOVE RULE MAKES SURE THAT THE PROGRAM WILL OPERATE
*      CORRECTLY IN IMPLEMENTATIONS WITH NO AUTOMATIC CHECK.
*
*      IF STACK OVERFLOW OCCURS (DETECTED EITHER AUTOMATICALLY
*      OR BY A CHK INSTRUCTION), THEN CONTROL IS PASSED TO THE
*      STACK OVERFLOW SECTION (SEE PROGRAM FORM). NOTE THAT THIS
*      TRANSFER MAY TAKE PLACE FOLLOWING ANY INSTRUCTION WHICH
*      STORES DATA AT A NEW LOCATION ON THE STACK.
*      AFTER STACK OVERFLOW, STACK IS ARBITRARILY POPPED
*      TO GIVE SOME SPACE IN WHICH THE ERROR PROCEDURE MAY
*      OPERATE. OTHERWISE A LOOP OF STACK OVERFLOWS MAY OCCUR.

*
*      GENERAL STRUCTURE
*      -----------------
*
*      THIS PROGRAM IS A TRANSLATOR FOR A VERSION OF THE SNOBOL4
*      PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. LANGUAGE DETAILS ARE CONTAINED IN
*      THE MANUAL MACRO SPITBOL BY DEWAR AND MCCANN, TECHNICAL
*      REPORT 90, UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS 1976.
*      THE IMPLEMENTATION IS DISCUSSED IN DEWAR AND MCCANN,
*      MACRO SPITBOL - A SNOBOL4 COMPILER, SOFTWARE PRACTICE AND
*      EXPERIENCE, 7, 95-113, 1977.
*      THE LANGUAGE IS AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE BTL TRANSLATOR
*      (GRISWOLD, POAGE AND POLONSKY, PRENTICE HALL, 1971)
*      WITH THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL EXCEPTIONS.
*
*      1)   REDEFINITION OF STANDARD SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AND
*           OPERATORS IS NOT PERMITTED.
*
*      2)   THE VALUE FUNCTION IS NOT PROVIDED.
*
*      3)   ACCESS TRACING IS PROVIDED IN ADDITION TO THE
*           OTHER STANDARD TRACE MODES.
*
*      4)   THE KEYWORD STFCOUNT IS NOT PROVIDED.
*
*      5)   THE KEYWORD FULLSCAN IS NOT PROVIDED AND ALL PATTERN
*           MATCHING TAKES PLACE IN FULLSCAN MODE (I.E. WITH NO
*           HEURISTICS APPLIED).
*
*      6)   A SERIES OF EXPRESSIONS SEPARATED BY COMMAS MAY
*           BE GROUPED WITHIN PARENTHESES TO PROVIDE A SELECTION
*           CAPABILITY. THE SEMANTICS ARE THAT THE SELECTION
*           ASSUMES THE VALUE OF THE FIRST EXPRESSION WITHIN IT
*           WHICH SUCCEEDS AS THEY ARE EVALUATED FROM THE LEFT.
*           IF NO EXPRESSION SUCCEEDS THE ENTIRE STATEMENT FAILS
*
*      7)   AN EXPLICIT PATTERN MATCHING OPERATOR IS PROVIDED.
*           THIS IS THE BINARY QUERY (SEE GIMPEL SIGPLAN OCT 74)
*
*      8)   THE ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR IS INTRODUCED AS IN THE
*           GIMPEL REFERENCE.
*
*      9)   THE EXIT FUNCTION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERATING LOAD
*           MODULES - CF. GIMPELS SITBOL.
*
*
*      THE METHOD USED IN THIS PROGRAM IS TO TRANSLATE THE
*      SOURCE CODE INTO AN INTERNAL PSEUDO-CODE (SEE FOLLOWING
*      SECTION). AN INTERPRETOR IS THEN USED TO EXECUTE THIS
*      GENERATED PSEUDO-CODE. THE NATURE OF THE SNOBOL4 LANGUAGE
*      IS SUCH THAT THE LATTER TASK IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN
*      THE ACTUAL TRANSLATION PHASE. ACCORDINGLY, NEARLY ALL THE
*      CODE IN THE PROGRAM SECTION IS CONCERNED WITH THE ACTUAL
*      EXECUTION OF THE SNOBOL4 PROGRAM.
       EJC
*
*      INTERPRETIVE CODE FORMAT
*      ------------------------
*
*      THE INTERPRETIVE PSEUDO-CODE CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF
*      ADDRESS POINTERS. THE EXACT FORMAT OF THE CODE IS
*      DESCRIBED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CDBLK FORMAT. THE
*      PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION IS TO GIVE GENERAL INSIGHT INTO
*      THE INTERPRETIVE APPROACH INVOLVED.
*
*      THE BASIC FORM OF THE CODE IS RELATED TO REVERSE POLISH.
*      IN OTHER WORDS, THE OPERANDS PRECEDE THE OPERATORS WHICH
*      ARE ZERO ADDRESS OPERATORS. THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO
*      THESE RULES, NOTABLY THE UNARY NOT OPERATOR AND THE
*      SELECTION CONSTRUCTION WHICH CLEARLY REQUIRE ADVANCE
*      KNOWLEDGE OF THE OPERATOR INVOLVED.
*
*      THE OPERANDS ARE MOVED TO THE TOP OF THE MAIN STACK AND
*      THE OPERATORS ARE APPLIED TO THE TOP STACK ENTRIES. LIKE
*      OTHER VERSIONS OF SPITBOL, THIS PROCESSOR DEPENDS ON
*      KNOWING WHETHER OPERANDS ARE REQUIRED BY NAME OR BY VALUE
*      AND MOVES THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT TO THE STACK. THUS NO
*      NAME/VALUE CHECKS ARE INCLUDED IN THE OPERATOR CIRCUITS.
*
*      THE ACTUAL POINTERS IN THE CODE POINT TO A BLOCK WHOSE
*      FIRST WORD IS THE ADDRESS OF THE INTERPRETOR ROUTINE
*      TO BE EXECUTED FOR THE CODE WORD.
*
*      IN THE CASE OF OPERATORS, THE POINTER IS TO A WORD WHICH
*      CONTAINS THE ADDRESS OF THE OPERATOR TO BE EXECUTED. IN
*      THE CASE OF OPERANDS SUCH AS CONSTANTS, THE POINTER IS TO
*      THE OPERAND ITSELF. ACCORDINGLY, ALL OPERANDS CONTAIN
*      A FIELD WHICH POINTS TO THE ROUTINE TO LOAD THE VALUE OF
*      THE OPERAND ONTO THE STACK. IN THE CASE OF A VARIABLE,
*      THERE ARE THREE SUCH POINTERS. ONE TO LOAD THE VALUE,
*      ONE TO STORE THE VALUE AND A THIRD TO JUMP TO THE LABEL.
*
*      THE HANDLING OF FAILURE RETURNS DESERVES SPECIAL COMMENT.
*      THE LOCATION FLPTR CONTAINS THE POINTER TO THE LOCATION
*      ON THE MAIN STACK WHICH CONTAINS THE FAILURE RETURN
*      WHICH IS IN THE FORM OF A BYTE OFFSET IN THE CURRENT
*      CODE BLOCK (CDBLK OR EXBLK). WHEN A FAILURE OCCURS, THE
*      STACK IS POPPED AS INDICATED BY THE SETTING OF FLPTR AND
*      CONTROL IS PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATE LOCATION IN THE
*      CURRENT CODE BLOCK WITH THE STACK POINTER POINTING TO THE
*      FAILURE OFFSET ON THE STACK AND FLPTR UNCHANGED.
       EJC
*
*      INTERNAL DATA REPRESENTATIONS
*      -----------------------------
*
*      REPRESENTATION OF VALUES
*
*      A VALUE IS REPRESENTED BY A POINTER TO A BLOCK WHICH
*      DESCRIBES THE TYPE AND PARTICULARS OF THE DATA VALUE.
*      IN GENERAL, A VARIABLE IS A LOCATION CONTAINING SUCH A
*      POINTER (ALTHOUGH IN THE CASE OF TRACE ASSOCIATIONS THIS
*      IS MODIFIED, SEE DESCRIPTION OF TRBLK).
*
*      THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF POSSIBLE DATATYPES SHOWING THE
*      TYPE OF BLOCK USED TO HOLD THE VALUE. THE DETAILS OF
*      EACH BLOCK FORMAT ARE GIVEN LATER.
*
*      DATATYPE              BLOCK TYPE
*      --------              ----------
*
*      ARRAY                 ARBLK OR VCBLK

*      EXPRESSION            EXBLK OR SEBLK
*

       EJC
*
*      REPRESENTATION OF VARIABLES
*      ---------------------------
*
*      DURING THE COURSE OF EVALUATING EXPRESSIONS, IT IS
*      NECESSARY TO GENERATE NAMES OF VARIABLES (FOR EXAMPLE
*      ON THE LEFT SIDE OF A BINARY EQUALS OPERATOR). THESE ARE
*      NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH OBJECTS OF DATATYPE NAME WHICH
*      ARE IN FACT VALUES.
*
*      FROM A LOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, SUCH NAMES COULD BE SIMPLY
*      REPRESENTED BY A POINTER TO THE APPROPRIATE VALUE CELL.
*      HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF ARRAYS AND PROGRAM DEFINED
*      DATATYPES, THIS WOULD VIOLATE THE RULE THAT THERE MUST BE
*      NO POINTERS INTO THE MIDDLE OF A BLOCK IN DYNAMIC STORE.
*      ACCORDINGLY, A NAME IS ALWAYS REPRESENTED BY A BASE AND
*      OFFSET. THE BASE POINTS TO THE START OF THE BLOCK
*      CONTAINING THE VARIABLE VALUE AND THE OFFSET IS THE
*      OFFSET WITHIN THIS BLOCK IN BYTES. THUS THE ADDRESS
*      OF THE ACTUAL VARIABLE IS DETERMINED BY ADDING THE BASE
*      AND OFFSET VALUES.
*
*      THE FOLLOWING ARE THE INSTANCES OF VARIABLES REPRESENTED
*      IN THIS MANNER.
*
*      1)   NATURAL VARIABLE BASE IS PTR TO VRBLK
*                            OFFSET IS *VRVAL
*
*      2)   TABLE ELEMENT    BASE IS PTR TO TEBLK
*                            OFFSET IS *TEVAL

*      ORGANIZATION OF DATA AREA
*      -------------------------
*
*      THE DATA AREA IS DIVIDED INTO TWO REGIONS.
*
*      STATIC AREA
*
*      THE STATIC AREA BUILDS UP FROM THE BOTTOM AND CONTAINS
*      DATA AREAS WHICH ARE ALLOCATED DYNAMICALLY BUT ARE NEVER
*      DELETED OR MOVED AROUND. THE MACRO-PROGRAM ITSELF
*      USES THE STATIC AREA FOR THE FOLLOWING.
*
*      1)   ALL VARIABLE BLOCKS (VRBLK).
*
*      2)   THE HASH TABLE FOR VARIABLE BLOCKS.
*
*      3)   MISCELLANEOUS BUFFERS AND WORK AREAS (SEE PROGRAM
*           INITIALIZATION SECTION).
*
*      IN ADDITION, THE SYSTEM PROCEDURES MAY USE THIS AREA FOR
*      INPUT/OUTPUT BUFFERS, EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS ETC. SPACE IN
*      THE STATIC REGION IS ALLOCATED BY CALLING PROCEDURE ALOST
*
*      THE FOLLOWING GLOBAL VARIABLES DEFINE THE CURRENT
*      LOCATION AND SIZE OF THE STATIC AREA.
*
*      STATB                 ADDRESS OF START OF STATIC AREA
*      STATE                 ADDRESS+1 OF LAST WORD IN AREA.
*
*      THE MINIMUM SIZE OF STATIC IS GIVEN APPROXIMATELY BY
*           12 + *E$HNB + *E$STS + SPACE FOR ALPHABET STRING
*           AND STANDARD PRINT BUFFER.
       EJC
*      DYNAMIC AREA
*
*      THE DYNAMIC AREA IS BUILT UPWARDS IN MEMORY AFTER THE
*      STATIC REGION. DATA IN THIS AREA MUST ALL BE IN STANDARD
*      BLOCK FORMATS SO THAT IT CAN BE PROCESSED BY THE GARBAGE
*      COLLECTOR (PROCEDURE GBCOL). GBCOL COMPACTS BLOCKS DOWN
*      IN THIS REGION AS REQUIRED BY SPACE EXHAUSTION AND CAN
*      ALSO MOVE ALL BLOCKS UP TO ALLOW FOR EXPANSION OF THE
*      STATIC REGION.
*      WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TABLES AND ARRAYS, NO SPITBOL
*      OBJECT ONCE BUILT IN DYNAMIC MEMORY IS EVER SUBSEQUENTLY
*      MODIFIED. OBSERVING THIS RULE NECESSITATES A COPYING
*      ACTION DURING STRING AND PATTERN CONCATENATION.
*
*      GARBAGE COLLECTION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ALLOCATION OF
*      SPACE FOR VALUES. SPITBOL USES A VERY EFFICIENT GARBAGE
*      COLLECTOR WHICH INSISTS THAT POINTERS INTO DYNAMIC STORE
*      SHOULD BE IDENTIFIABLE WITHOUT USE OF BIT TABLES,
*      MARKER BITS ETC. TO SATISFY THIS REQUIREMENT, DYNAMIC
*      MEMORY MUST NOT START AT TOO LOW AN ADDRESS AND LENGTHS
*      OF ARRAYS, TABLES, STRINGS, CODE AND EXPRESSION BLOCKS
*      MAY NOT EXCEED THE NUMERICAL VALUE OF THE LOWEST DYNAMIC
*      ADDRESS.
*
*      TO AVOID EITHER PENALIZING USERS WITH MODEST
*      REQUIREMENTS OR RESTRICTING THOSE WITH GREATER NEEDS ON
*      HOST SYSTEMS WHERE DYNAMIC MEMORY IS ALLOCATED IN LOW
*      ADDRESSES, THE MINIMUM DYNAMIC ADDRESS MAY BE SPECIFIED
*      SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO PERMIT ARBITRARILY LARGE SPITBOL
*      OBJECTS TO BE CREATED (WITH THE POSSIBILITY IN EXTREME
*      CASES OF WASTING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MEMORY BELOW THE
*      START ADDRESS). THIS MINIMUM VALUE IS MADE AVAILABLE
*      IN VARIABLE MXLEN BY A SYSTEM ROUTINE, SYSMX.
*      ALTERNATIVELY SYSMX MAY INDICATE THAT A
*      DEFAULT MAY BE USED IN WHICH DYNAMIC IS PLACED
*      AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE ADDRESS FOLLOWING STATIC.
*
*      THE FOLLOWING GLOBAL WORK CELLS DEFINE THE LOCATION AND
*      LENGTH OF THE DYNAMIC AREA.
*
*      DNAMB                 START OF DYNAMIC AREA
*      DNAMP                 NEXT AVAILABLE LOCATION
*      DNAME                 LAST AVAILABLE LOCATION + 1
*
*      DNAMB IS ALWAYS HIGHER THAN STATE SINCE THE ALOST
*      PROCEDURE MAINTAINS SOME EXPANSION SPACE ABOVE STATE.
*      *** DNAMB MUST NEVER BE PERMITTED TO HAVE A VALUE LESS
*      THAN THAT IN MXLEN ***
*
*      SPACE IN THE DYNAMIC REGION IS ALLOCATED BY THE ALLOC
*      PROCEDURE. THE DYNAMIC REGION MAY BE USED BY SYSTEM
*      PROCEDURES PROVIDED THAT ALL THE RULES ARE OBEYED.
*      SOME OF THE RULES ARE SUBTLE SO IT IS PREFERABLE FOR
*      OSINT TO MANAGE ITS OWN MEMORY NEEDS. SPITBOL PROCS
*      OBEY RULES TO ENSURE THAT NO ACTION CAN CAUSE A GARBAGE
*      COLLECTION EXCEPT AT SUCH TIMES AS CONTENTS OF XL, XR
*      AND THE STACK ARE +CLEAN+ (SEE COMMENT BEFORE UTILITY
*      PROCEDURES AND IN GBCOL FOR MORE DETAIL). NOTE
*      THAT CALLS OF ALOST MAY CAUSE GARBAGE COLLECTION (SHIFT
*      OF MEMORY TO FREE SPACE). SPITBOL PROCS WHICH CALL
*      SYSTEM ROUTINES ASSUME THAT THEY CANNOT PRECIPITATE
*      COLLECTION AND THIS MUST BE RESPECTED.

*      DATA BLOCK FORMATS AND DEFINITIONS
*
*      THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE THE DETAILED FORMAT OF
*      ALL POSSIBLE DATA BLOCKS IN STATIC AND DYNAMIC MEMORY.
*
*      EVERY BLOCK HAS A NAME OF THE FORM XXBLK WHERE XX IS A
*      UNIQUE TWO CHARACTER IDENTIFIER. THE FIRST WORD OF EVERY
*      BLOCK MUST CONTAIN A POINTER TO A PROGRAM LOCATION IN THE
*      INTERPRETOR WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY AN ADDRESS
*      CONSTANT CONTAINING THE VALUE BL$XX WHERE XX IS THE BLOCK
*      IDENTIFIER. THIS PROVIDES A UNIFORM MECHANISM FOR
*      DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE VARIOUS BLOCK TYPES.
*
*      IN SOME CASES, THE CONTENTS OF THE FIRST WORD IS CONSTANT
*      FOR A GIVEN BLOCK TYPE AND MERELY SERVES AS A POINTER
*      TO THE IDENTIFYING ADDRESS CONSTANT. HOWEVER, IN OTHER
*      CASES THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FIRST
*      WORD IN WHICH CASE EACH OF THE SEVERAL PROGRAM ENTRY
*      POINTS MUST BE PRECEDED BY THE APPROPRIATE CONSTANT.
*
*      IN EACH BLOCK, SOME OF THE FIELDS ARE RELOCATABLE. THIS
*      MEANS THAT THEY MAY CONTAIN A POINTER TO ANOTHER BLOCK
*      IN THE DYNAMIC AREA. (TO BE MORE PRECISE, IF THEY CONTAIN
*      A POINTER WITHIN THE DYNAMIC AREA, THEN IT IS A POINTER
*      TO A BLOCK). SUCH FIELDS MUST BE MODIFIED BY THE GARBAGE
*      COLLECTOR (PROCEDURE GBCOL) WHENEVER BLOCKS ARE COMPACTED
*      IN THE DYNAMIC REGION. THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR (ACTUALLY
*      PROCEDURE GBCPF) REQUIRES THAT ALL SUCH RELOCATABLE
*      FIELDS IN A BLOCK MUST BE CONTIGUOUS.
       EJC
*
*      THE DESCRIPTION FORMAT USES THE FOLLOWING SCHEME.
*
*      1)   BLOCK TITLE AND TWO CHARACTER IDENTIFIER
*
*      2)   DESCRIPTION OF BASIC USE OF BLOCK AND INDICATION
*           OF CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH IT IS CONSTRUCTED.
*
*      3)   PICTURE OF THE BLOCK FORMAT. IN THESE PICTURES LOW
*           MEMORY ADDRESSES ARE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE. FIXED
*           LENGTH FIELDS ARE SURROUNDED BY I (LETTER I). FIELDS
*           WHICH ARE FIXED LENGTH BUT WHOSE LENGTH IS DEPENDENT
*           ON A CONFIGURATION PARAMETER ARE SURROUNDED BY *

*
*      THE WORKING STORAGE SECTION CONTAINS AREAS WHICH ARE
*      CHANGED DURING EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM. THE VALUE
*      ASSEMBLED IS THE INITIAL VALUE BEFORE EXECUTION STARTS.
*
*      ALL THESE AREAS ARE FIXED LENGTH AREAS. VARIABLE LENGTH
*      DATA IS STORED IN THE STATIC OR DYNAMIC REGIONS OF THE
*      ALLOCATED DATA AREAS.
*
*      THE VALUES IN THIS AREA ARE DESCRIBED EITHER AS WORK
*      AREAS OR AS GLOBAL VALUES. A WORK AREA IS USED IN AN
*      EPHEMERAL MANNER AND THE VALUE IS NOT SAVED FROM ONE
*      ENTRY INTO A ROUTINE TO ANOTHER. A GLOBAL VALUE IS A
*      LESS TEMPORARY LOCATION WHOSE VALUE IS SAVED FROM ONE
*      CALL TO ANOTHER.
*
*      W$AAA MARKS THE START OF THE WORKING SECTION WHILST
*      W$YYY MARKS ITS END.  G$AAA MARKS THE DIVISION BETWEEN
*      TEMPORARY AND GLOBAL VALUES.
*
*      GLOBAL VALUES ARE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED TO FACILITATE
*      PROCESSING BY THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR. R$AAA THROUGH
*      R$YYY ARE GLOBAL VALUES THAT MAY POINT INTO DYNAMIC
*      STORAGE AND HENCE MUST BE RELOCATED AFTER EACH GARBAGE
*      COLLECTION.  THEY ALSO SERVE AS ROOT POINTERS TO ALL
*      ALLOCATED DATA THAT MUST BE PRESERVED.  POINTERS BETWEEN
*      A$AAA AND R$AAA MAY POINT INTO CODE, STATIC STORAGE,
*      OR MARK THE LIMITS OF DYNAMIC MEMORY.  THESE POINTERS
*      MUST BE ADJUSTED WHEN THE WORKING SECTION IS SAVED TO A
*      FILE AND SUBSEQUENTLY RELOADED AT A DIFFERENT ADDRESS.
*
*      A GENERAL PART OF THE APPROACH IN THIS PROGRAM IS NOT
*      TO OVERLAP WORK AREAS BETWEEN PROCEDURES EVEN THOUGH A
*      SMALL AMOUNT OF SPACE COULD BE SAVED. SUCH OVERLAP IS
*      CONSIDERED A SOURCE OF PROGRAM ERRORS AND DECREASES THE
*      INFORMATION LEFT BEHIND AFTER A SYSTEM CRASH OF ANY KIND.
*
*      THE NAMES OF THESE LOCATIONS ARE LABELS WITH FIVE LETTER
*      (A-Y,$) NAMES. AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE ORDER IS KEPT
*      ALPHABETICAL BY THESE NAMES BUT IN SOME CASES THERE
*      ARE SLIGHT DEPARTURES CAUSED BY OTHER ORDER REQUIREMENTS.
*
*      UNLESS OTHERWISE DOCUMENTED, THE ORDER OF WORK AREAS
*      DOES NOT AFFECT THE EXECUTION OF THE SPITBOL PROGRAM.

*      INITIAL ENTRY FOR A PATTERN NODE IS TO THE ROUTINE P$EXA.
*      IF THE EVALUATED RESULT OF THE EXPRESSION IS ITSELF A
*      PATTERN, THEN THE FOLLOWING STEPS ARE TAKEN TO ARRANGE
*      FOR PROPER RECURSIVE PROCESSING.
*
*      1)   A POINTER TO THE CURRENT NODE (THE P$EXA NODE) IS
*           STORED ON THE HISTORY STACK WITH A DUMMY CURSOR.
*
*      2)   A SPECIAL HISTORY STACK ENTRY IS MADE IN WHICH THE
*           NODE POINTER POINTS TO NDEXB, AND THE CURSOR VALUE
*           IS THE SAVED VALUE OF PMHBS ON ENTRY TO THIS NODE.
*           THE MATCH ROUTINE FOR NDEXB (P$EXB) RESTORES PMHBS
*           FROM THIS CURSOR ENTRY, POPS OFF THE P$EXA NODE
*           POINTER AND FAILS.
*
*      3)   THE RESULTING HISTORY STACK POINTER IS SAVED IN
*           PMHBS TO ESTABLISH A NEW LEVEL OF HISTORY STACK.
*
*      AFTER MATCHING A PATTERN, THE END OF MATCH ROUTINE GETS
*      CONTROL (P$NTH). THIS ROUTINE PROCEEDS AS FOLLOWS.
*
*      1)   LOAD THE CURRENT VALUE OF PMHBS AND RECOGNIZE THE
*           OUTER LEVEL CASE BY THE FACT THAT THE ASSOCIATED
*           CURSOR IN THIS CASE IS THE PATTERN MATCH TYPE CODE
*           WHICH IS LESS THAN 3. TERMINATE THE MATCH IN THIS
*           CASE AND CONTINUE EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM.
*
*      2)   OTHERWISE MAKE A SPECIAL HISTORY STACK ENTRY IN
*           WHICH THE NODE POINTER POINTS TO THE SPECIAL NODE
*           NDEXC AND THE CURSOR IS THE CURRENT VALUE OF PMHBS.
*           THE MATCH ROUTINE FOR NDEXC (P$EXC) RESETS PMHBS TO
*           THIS (INNER) VALUE AND AND THEN FAILS.
*
*      3)   USING THE HISTORY STACK ENTRY MADE ON STARTING THE
*           EXPRESSION (ACCESSIBLE WITH THE CURRENT VALUE OF
*           PMHBS), RESTORE THE P$EXA NODE POINTER AND THE OLD
*           PMHBS SETTING. TAKE THE SUCCESSOR AND CONTINUE.
*
*      AN OPTIMIZATION IS POSSIBLE IF THE EXPRESSION PATTERN
*      MAKES NO ENTRIES ON THE HISTORY STACK. IN THIS CASE,
*      INSTEAD OF BUILDING THE P$EXC NODE IN STEP 2, IT IS MORE
*      EFFICIENT TO SIMPLY POP OFF THE P$EXB ENTRY AND ITS
*      ASSOCIATED NODE POINTER. THE EFFECT IS THE SAME.

*      EVALP IS USED TO EVALUATE AN EXPRESSION (BY VALUE) DURING
*      A PATTERN MATCH. THE EFFECT IS LIKE EVALX, BUT PATTERN
*      VARIABLES ARE STACKED AND RESTORED IF NECESSARY.
*
*      EVALP ALSO DIFFERS FROM EVALX IN THAT IF THE RESULT IS
*      AN EXPRESSION IT IS REEVALUATED. THIS OCCURS REPEATEDLY.
*
*      TO SUPPORT OPTIMIZATION OF POS AND RPOS, EVALP USES WC
*      TO SIGNAL THE CALLER FOR THE CASE OF A SIMPLE VRBLK
*      THAT IS NOT AN EXPRESSION AND IS NOT TRAPPED.  BECAUSE
*      THIS CASE CANNOT HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS, OPTIMIZATION IS
*      POSSIBLE.

*
*      THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS MUST BE MET AT THE TIME WHEN
*      GBCOL IS CALLED.
*
*      1)   ALL POINTERS TO BLOCKS IN THE DYNAMIC AREA MUST BE
*           ACCESSIBLE TO THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR. THIS MEANS
*           THAT THEY MUST OCCUR IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING.
*
*           A)               MAIN STACK, WITH CURRENT TOP
*                            ELEMENT BEING INDICATED BY XS
*
*           B)               IN RELOCATABLE FIELDS OF VRBLKS.
*
*           C)               IN REGISTER XL AT THE TIME OF CALL
*
*           E)               IN THE SPECIAL REGION OF WORKING
*                            STORAGE WHERE NAMES BEGIN WITH R$.
*
*      2)   ALL POINTERS MUST POINT TO THE START OF BLOCKS WITH
*           THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF THE CONTENTS OF THE CODE
*           POINTER REGISTER WHICH POINTS INTO THE R$COD BLOCK.
*
*      3)   NO LOCATION WHICH APPEARS TO CONTAIN A POINTER
*           INTO THE DYNAMIC REGION MAY OCCUR UNLESS IT IS IN
*           FACT A POINTER TO THE START OF THE BLOCK. HOWEVER
*           POINTERS OUTSIDE THIS AREA MAY OCCUR AND WILL
*           NOT BE CHANGED BY THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR.
*           IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT XL
*           DOES NOT CONTAIN A GARBAGE VALUE FROM SOME PROCESS
*           CARRIED OUT BEFORE THE CALL TO THE COLLECTOR.
*
*      GBCOL HAS THE CAPABILITY OF MOVING THE FINAL COMPACTED
*      RESULT UP IN MEMORY (WITH ADDRESSES ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY)
*      THIS IS USED TO ADD SPACE TO THE STATIC REGION. THE
*      ENTRY VALUE OF WB IS THE NUMBER OF BYTES TO MOVE UP.
*      THE CALLER MUST GUARANTEE THAT THERE IS ENOUGH ROOM.
*      FURTHERMORE THE VALUE IN WB IF IT IS NON-ZERO, MUST BE AT
*      LEAST 256 SO THAT THE MWB INSTRUCTION CONDITIONS ARE MET.

*      GBCOL (CONTINUED)
*
*      THE ALGORITHM, WHICH IS A MODIFICATION OF THE LISP-2
*      GARBAGE COLLECTOR DEVISED BY R.DEWAR AND K.BELCHER
*      TAKES THREE PASSES AS FOLLOWS.
*
*      1)   ALL POINTERS IN MEMORY ARE SCANNED AND BLOCKS IN USE
*           DETERMINED FROM THIS SCAN. NOTE THAT THIS PROCEDURE
*           IS RECURSIVE AND USES THE MAIN STACK FOR LINKAGE.
*           THE MARKING PROCESS IS THUS SIMILAR TO THAT USED IN
*           A STANDARD LISP COLLECTOR. HOWEVER THE METHOD OF
*           ACTUALLY MARKING THE BLOCKS IS DIFFERENT.
*
*           THE FIRST FIELD OF A BLOCK NORMALLY CONTAINS A
*           CODE ENTRY POINT POINTER. SUCH AN ENTRY POINTER
*           CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ADDRESS OF ANY POINTER
*           TO BE PROCESSED BY THE COLLECTOR. DURING GARBAGE
*           COLLECTION, THIS WORD IS USED TO BUILD A BACK CHAIN
*           OF POINTERS THROUGH FIELDS WHICH POINT TO THE BLOCK.
*           THE END OF THE CHAIN IS MARKED BY THE OCCURENCE
*           OF THE WORD WHICH USED TO BE IN THE FIRST WORD OF
*           THE BLOCK. THIS BACKCHAIN SERVES BOTH AS A MARK
*           INDICATING THAT THE BLOCK IS IN USE AND AS A LIST OF
*           REFERENCES FOR THE RELOCATION PHASE.
*
*      2)   STORAGE IS SCANNED SEQUENTIALLY TO DISCOVER WHICH
*           BLOCKS ARE CURRENTLY IN USE AS INDICATED BY THE
*           PRESENCE OF A BACKCHAIN. TWO POINTERS ARE MAINTAINED
*           ONE SCANS THROUGH LOOKING AT EACH BLOCK. THE OTHER
*           IS INCREMENTED ONLY FOR BLOCKS FOUND TO BE IN USE.
*           IN THIS WAY, THE EVENTUAL LOCATION OF EACH BLOCK CAN
*           BE DETERMINED WITHOUT ACTUALLY MOVING ANY BLOCKS.
*           AS EACH BLOCK WHICH IS IN USE IS PROCESSED, THE BACK
*           CHAIN IS USED TO RESET ALL POINTERS WHICH POINT TO
*           THIS BLOCK TO CONTAIN ITS NEW ADDRESS, I.E. THE
*           ADDRESS IT WILL OCCUPY AFTER THE BLOCKS ARE MOVED.
*           THE FIRST WORD OF THE BLOCK, TAKEN FROM THE END OF
*           THE CHAIN IS RESTORED AT THIS POINT.
*
*           DURING PASS 2, THE COLLECTOR BUILDS BLOCKS WHICH
*           DESCRIBE THE REGIONS OF STORAGE WHICH ARE TO BE
*           MOVED IN THE THIRD PASS. THERE IS ONE DESCRIPTOR FOR
*           EACH CONTIGUOUS SET OF GOOD BLOCKS. THE DESCRIPTOR
*           IS BUILT JUST BEHIND THE BLOCK TO BE MOVED AND
*           CONTAINS A POINTER TO THE NEXT BLOCK AND THE NUMBER
*           OF WORDS TO BE MOVED.
*
*      3)   IN THE THIRD AND FINAL PASS, THE MOVE DESCRIPTOR
*           BLOCKS BUILT IN PASS TWO ARE USED TO ACTUALLY MOVE
*           THE BLOCKS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE DYNAMIC REGION.
*           THE COLLECTION IS THEN COMPLETE AND THE NEXT
*           AVAILABLE LOCATION POINTER IS RESET.

*
*      GBCOL (CONTINUED)
*
.IF    .CSED
*      THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR ALSO RECOGNIZES THE CONCEPT OF
*      SEDIMENT.  SEDIMENT IS DEFINED AS LONG-LIVED OBJECTS
*      WHICH PERCIPITATE TO THE BOTTOM OF DYNAMIC STORAGE.
*      MOVING THESE OBJECTS DURING REPEATED COLLECTIONS IS
*      INEFFICIENT.  IT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THRASHING ON
*      SYSTEMS WITH VIRTUAL MEMORY.  IN A TYPICAL WORST-CASE
*      SITUATION, THERE MAY BE SEVERAL MEGABYTES OF LIVE OBJECTS
*      IN THE SEDIMENT, AND ONLY A FEW DEAD OBJECTS IN NEED OF
*      COLLECTION.  WITHOUT RECOGNISING SEDIMENT, THE STANDARD
*      COLLECTOR WOULD MOVE THOSE MEGABYTES OF OBJECTS DOWNWARD
*      TO SQUEEZE OUT THE DEAD OBJECTS.  THIS TYPE OF MOVE
*      WOULD RESULT IN EXCESSIVE THRASING FOR VERY LITTLE MEMORY
*      GAIN.
*
*      SCANNING OF BLOCKS IN THE SEDIMENT CANNOT BE AVOIDED
*      ENTIRELY, BECAUSE THESE BLOCKS MAY CONTAIN POINTERS TO
*      LIVE OBJECTS ABOVE THE SEDIMENT.  HOWEVER, SEDIMENT
*      BLOCKS NEED NOT BE LINKED TO A BACK CHAIN AS DESCRIBED
*      IN PASS ONE ABOVE.  SINCE THESE BLOCKS WILL NOT BE MOVED,
*      POINTERS TO THEM DO NOT NEED TO BE ADJUSTED.  ELIMINATING
*      UNNECESSARY BACK CHAIN LINKS INCREASES LOCALITY OF
*      REFERENCE, IMPROVING VIRTUAL MEMORY PERFORMANCE.
*
*      BECAUSE BACK CHAINS ARE USED TO MARK BLOCKS WHOSE CON-
*      TENTS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED, A DIFFERENT MARKING SYSTEM
.IF    .CEPP
*      IS NEEDED FOR BLOCKS IN THE SEDIMENT.  SINCE BLOCK TYPE
*      WORDS POINT TO ODD-PARITY ENTRY ADDRESSES, MERELY INCRE-
*      MENTING THE TYPE WORD SERVES TO MARK THE BLOCK AS PRO-
*      CESSED.  DURING PASS THREE, THE TYPE WORDS ARE DECRE-
*      MENTED TO RESTORE THEM TO THEIR ORIGINAL VALUE.
.ELSE
*      IS NEEDED FOR BLOCKS IN THE SEDIMENT.  ALL BLOCK TYPE
*      WORDS NORMALLY LIE IN THE RANGE B$AAA TO P$YYY.  BLOCKS
*      CAN BE MARKED BY ADDING AN OFFSET (CREATED IN GBCMK) TO
*      MOVE TYPE WORDS OUT OF THIS RANGE.  DURING PASS THREE THE
*      OFFSET IS SUBTRACTED TO RESTORE THEM TO THEIR ORIGINAL
*      VALUE.

*
*
*      THE VARIABLE DNAMS CONTAINS THE NUMBER OF BYTES OF MEMORY
*      CURRENTLY IN THE SEDIMENT.  SETTING DNAMS TO ZERO WILL
*      ELIMINATE THE SEDIMENT AND FORCE IT TO BE INCLUDED IN A
*      FULL GARBAGE COLLECTION.  GBCOL RETURNS A SUGGESTED NEW
*      VALUE FOR DNAMS (USUALLY DNAMP-DNAMB) IN XR WHICH THE
*      CALLER CAN STORE IN DNAMS IF IT WISHES TO MAINTAIN THE
*      SEDIMENT.  THAT IS, DATA REMAINING AFTER A GARBAGE
*      COLLECTION IS CONSIDERED TO BE SEDIMENT.  IF ONE ACCEPTS
*      THE COMMON LORE THAT MOST OBJECTS ARE EITHER VERY SHORT-
*      OR VERY LONG-LIVED, THEN THIS NAIVE SETTING OF DNAMS
*      PROBABLY INCLUDES SOME SHORT-LIVED OBJECTS TOWARD THE END
*      OF THE SEDIMENT.
*
*      KNOWING WHEN TO RESET DNAMS TO ZERO TO COLLECT THE SEDI-
*      MENT IS NOT PRECISELY KNOWN.  WE FORCE IT TO ZERO PRIOR
*      TO PRODUCING A DUMP, WHEN GBCOL IS INVOKED BY COLLECT()
*      (SO THAT THE SEDIMENT IS INVISIBLE TO THE USER), WHEN
*      SYSMM IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL MEMORY, AND WHEN
*      GBCOL IS CALLED TO RELOCATE THE DYNAMIC AREA UP IN MEMORY
*      (TO MAKE ROOM FOR ENLARGING THE STATIC AREA).  IF THERE
*      ARE NO OTHER RESET SITUATIONS, THIS LEADS TO THE INEXO-
*      RABLE GROWTH OF THE SEDIMENT, POSSIBLE FORCING A MODEST
*      PROGRAM TO BEGIN TO USE VIRTUAL MEMORY THAT IT OTHERWISE
*      WOULD NOT.
*
*      AS WE SCAN SEDIMENT BLOCKS IN PASS THREE, WE MAINTAIN
*      AGGREGATE COUNTS OF THE AMOUNT OF DEAD AND LIVE STORAGE,
*      WHICH IS USED TO DECIDE WHEN TO RESET DNAMS.  WHEN THE
*      RATIO OF FREE STORAGE FOUND IN THE SEDIMENT TO TOTAL
*      SEDIMENT SIZE EXCEEDS A THRESHOLD, THE SEDIMENT IS MARKED
*      FOR COLLECTION ON THE NEXT GBCOL CALL.

*
*      ROUTINE TO SORT AN ARRAY OR TABLE ON SAME BASIS AS IN
*      SITBOL. A TABLE IS CONVERTED TO AN ARRAY, LEAVING TWO
*      DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS AND VECTORS AS CASES TO BE CONSIDERED.
*      WHOLE ROWS OF ARRAYS ARE PERMUTED ACCORDING TO THE
*      ORDERING OF THE KEYS THEY CONTAIN, AND THE STRIDE
*      REFERRED TO, IS THE THE LENGTH OF A ROW. IT IS ONE
*      FOR A VECTOR.
*      THE SORT USED IS HEAPSORT, FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA STRUCTURE
*      HOROWITZ AND SAHNI, PITMAN 1977, PAGE 347.
*      IT IS AN ORDER N*LOG(N) ALGORITHM. IN ORDER
*      TO MAKE IT STABLE, COMPARANDS MAY NOT COMPARE EQUAL. THIS
*      IS ACHIEVED BY SORTING A COPY ARRAY (REFERRED TO AS THE
*      SORT ARRAY) CONTAINING AT ITS HIGH ADDRESS END, BYTE
*      OFFSETS TO THE ROWS TO BE SORTED HELD IN THE ORIGINAL
*      ARRAY (REFERRED TO AS THE KEY ARRAY). SORTC, THE
*      COMPARISON ROUTINE, ACCESSES THE KEYS THROUGH THESE
*      OFFSETS AND IN THE CASE OF EQUALITY, RESOLVES IT BY
*      COMPARING THE OFFSETS THEMSELVES. THE SORT PERMUTES THE
*      OFFSETS WHICH ARE THEN USED IN A FINAL OPERATION TO COPY
*      THE ACTUAL ITEMS INTO THE NEW ARRAY IN SORTED ORDER.
*      REFERENCES TO ZEROTH ITEM ARE TO NOTIONAL ITEM
*      PRECEDING FIRST ACTUAL ITEM.
*      REVERSE SORTING FOR RSORT IS DONE BY HAVING THE LESS THAN
*      TEST FOR KEYS EFFECTIVELY BE REPLACED BY A
