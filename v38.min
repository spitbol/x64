       ttl  minimal -- machine independent macro assembly lang.
       ejc
*
*      the following sections describe the implementation
*      language originally developed for spitbol but now more
*      widely used. minimal is an assembly language
*      for an idealized machine. the following describes the
*      basic characteristics of this machine.
*
*      section 1 - configuration parameters
*
*      there are several parameters which may vary with the
*      target machine. the macro-program is independent of the
*      actual definitions of these parameters.
*
*      the definitions of these parameters are supplied by
*      the translation program to match the target machine.
*
*      cfp$a                 number of distinct characters in
*                            internal alphabet in the range
*                            64 le cfp$a le mxlen.
*
*      cfp$b                 number of bytes in a word where a
*                            byte is the amount of storage
*                            addressed by the least significant
*                            address bit.
*
*      cfp$c                 number of characters which can
*                            be stored in a single word.
*
*      cfp$f                 byte offset from start of a string
*                            block to the first character.
*                            depends both on target machine and
*                            string data structure. see plc, psc
*
*      cfp$i                 number of words in a signed
*                            integer constant
*
*      cfp$l                 the largest unsigned integer
*                            of form 2**n - 1 which can be
*                            stored in a single word.  n will
*                            often be cfp$n but need not be.
*
*      cfp$m                 the largest positive signed integer
*                            of form 2**n - 1 which can be
*                            stored in a single word.  n will
*                            often be cfp$n-1 but need not be.
*
*      cfp$n                 number of bits which can be stored
*                            in a one word bit string.
*
*      cfp$r                 number of words in a real constant
*
*      cfp$s                 number of significant digits to
*                            be output in conversion of a real
*                            quantity.

       ejc
*
*      section 2 - memory
*
*      memory is organized into words which each contain cfp$b
*      bytes. for word machines cfp$b, which is a configuration
*      parameter, may be one in which case words and bytes are
*      identical. to each word corresponds an address which is
*      a non-negative quantity which is a multiple of cfp$b.
*      data is organized into words as follows.
*
*      1)   a signed integer value occupies cfp$i consecutive
*           words (cfp$i is a configuration parameter).
*           the range may include more negative numbers than
*           positive (e.g. the twos complement representation).
*
*      2)   a signed real value occupies cfp$r consecutive
*           words. (cfp$r is a configuration parameter).
*
*      3)   cfp$c characters may be stored in a single word
*           (cfp$c is a configuration parameter).
*
*      4)   a bit string containing cfp$n bits can be stored in
*           a single word (cfp$n is a configuration parameter).
*
*      5)   a word can contain a unsigned integer value in
*           the range (0 le n le cfp$l). these integer values
*           may represent addresses of other words and some of
*           the instructions use this fact to provide indexing
*           and indirection facilities.
*
*      6)   program instructions occupy words in an undefined
*           manner. depending on the actual implementation,
*           instructions may occupy several words, or part of
*           a word, or even be split over word boundaries.
*
*      the following regions of memory are available to the
*      program. each region consists of a series of words with
*      consecutive addresses.
*
*      1)   constant section           assembled constants
*      2)   working storage section    assembled work areas
*      3)   program section            assembled instructions
*      4)   stack area                 allocated stack area
*      5)   data area                  allocated data area
       ejc
*
*      section 3 - registers
*
*      there are three index registers called xr,xl,xs. in
*      addition xl may sometimes be referred to by the alias
*      of xt - see section 4. any of the above registers
*      may hold a positive unsigned integer in the range
*      (0 le n le cfp$l). when the index register is used for
*      indexing purposes, this must be an appropriate address.
*      xs is special in that it is used to point to the top
*      item of a stack in memory. the stack may build up or
*      down in memory.since it is required that xs points to the
*      stack top but access to items below the top is permitted,
*      registers xs and xt may be used with suitable offsets
*      to index stacked items. only xs and xt may be used for
*      this purpose since the direction of the offset is
*      target machine dependent. xt is a synonym for xl
*      which therefore cannot be used in code sequences
*      referencing xt.
*
*      the stack is used for s-r linkage and temporary
*      data storage for which the stack arrangement is suitable.
*      xr,xl can also contain a character pointer in conjunction
*      with the character instructions (see description of plc).
       ejc
*
*      there are three work registers called wa,wb,wc which
*      can contain any data item which can be stored in a
*      single memory word. in fact, the work registers are just
*      like memory locations except that they have no addresses
*      and are referenced in a special way by the instructions.
*
*      note that registers wa,wb have special uses in connection
*      with the cvd, cvm, mvc, mvw, mwb, cmc, trc instructions.
*
*      register wc may overlap the integer accumulator (ia) in
*      some implementations. thus any operation changing the
*      value in wc leaves (ia) undefined and vice versa
*      except as noted in the following restriction on simple
*      dump/restore operations.
*
*          restriction
*          -----------
*
*      if ia and wc overlap then
*          sti  iasav
*          ldi  iasav
*      does not change wc, and
*          mov  wc,wcsav
*          mov  wcsav,wc
*      does not change ia.
*
*
*
*      there is an integer accumulator (ia) which is capable of
*      holding a signed integer value (cfp$i words long).
*      register wc may overlap the integer accumulator (ia) in
*      some implementations. thus any operation changing the
*      value in wc leaves (ia) undefined and vice versa
*      except as noted in the above restriction on simple
*      dump/restore operations.
*
*
*
*      there is a single real accumulator (ra) which can hold
*      any real value and is completely separate from any of
*      the other registers or program accessible locations.
*
*
*
*      the code pointer register (cp) is a special index
*      register for use in implementations of interpretors.
*      it is used to contain a pseudo-code pointer and can
*      only be affected by icp, lcp, scp and lcw instructions.
       ejc
*      section 4 - the stack
*
*      the following notes are to guide both implementors of
*      systems written in minimal and minimal programmers in
*      dealing with stack manipulation. implementation of a
*      downwards building stack is easiest and in general is
*      to be preferred, in which case it is merely necessary to
*      consider xt as an alternative name for xl.
*
*      the minimal virtual machine includes a stack and has
*      operand formats -(xs) and (xs)+ for pushing and popping
*      items with an implication that the stack builds down in
*      memory (a d-stack). however on some target machines it is
*      better for the stack to build up (a u-stack).
*      a stack addressed only by push and pop operations can
*      build in either direction with no complication but
*      such a pure scheme of stack access proves restrictive.
*      hence it is permitted to access buried items using an
*      integer offset past the index register pointing to the
*      stack top. on target machines this offset will be
*      positive/negative for d-stacks/u-stacks and this must
*      be allowed for in the translation.
*      a further restriction is that at no time may an item be
*      placed above the stack top. for some operations this
*      makes it convenient to advance the stack pointer and then
*      address items below it using a second index register.
*      the problem of signed offsets past such a register then
*      arises. to distinguish stack offsets, which in some
*      implementations may be negative, from non-stack offsets
*      which are invariably positive, xt, an alias or
*      synonym for xl is used. for a u-stack implementation, the
*      minimal translator should negate the sign of offsets
*      applied to both (xs) and (xt).
*      programmers should note that since xt is not a
*      separate register, xl should not be used in code where
*      xt is referenced. other modifications needed in u-stack
*      translations are in the add, sub, ica, dca opcodes
*      applied to xs, xt. for example
*
*      minimal           d-stack trans.  u-stack trans.
*
*      mov  wa,-(xs)     sbi  xs,1       adi  xs,1
*                        sto  wa,(xs)    sto  wa,(xs)
*      mov  (xt)+,wc     lod  wc,(xl)    lod  wc,(xl)
*                        adi  xl,1       sbi  xl,1
*      add  =seven,xs    adi  xs,7       sbi  xs,7
*      mov  2(xt),wa     lod  wa,2(xl)   lod  wa,-2(xl)
*      ica  xs           adi  xs,1       sbi  xs,1
*
*      note that forms such as
*      mov  -(xs),wa
*      add  wa,(xs)+
*      are illegal, since they assume information storage
*      above the stack top.
       ejc
*      section 5 - internal character set
*
*      the internal character set is represented by a set of
*      contiguous codes from 0 to cfp$a-1. the codes for the
*      digits 0-9 must be contiguous and in sequence. other
*      than this, there are no restraints.
*
*      the following symbols are automatically defined to have
*      the value of the corresponding internal character code.
*
*      ch$la                 letter a

       ejc
*
*      section 6 - conditional assembly features
*
*      some features of the interpreter are applicable to only
*      certain target machines. they may be incorporated or
*      omitted by use of conditional assembly. the full
*      form of a condition is -
*      .if    conditional assembly symbol    (cas)
*      .then
*             minimal statements1   (ms1)
*      .else
*             minimal statements2   (ms2)
*      .fi
*      the following rules apply
*      1.   the directives .if, .then, .else, .fi must
*           start in column 1.
*      2.   the conditional assembly symbol must start with a
*           dot in column 8 followed by 4 letters or digits e.g.
*              .ca$1
*      3.   .then is redundant and may be omitted if wished.
*      4.   ms1, ms2 are arbitrary sequences of minimal
*           statements either of which may be null or may
*           contain further conditions.
*      5.   if ms2 is omitted, .else may also be omitted.
*      6.   .fi is required.
*      7.   conditions may be nested to a depth determined
*           by the translator (not less than 20, say).
*
*      selection of the alternatives ms1, ms2 is by means of the
*      define and undefine directives of form -
*      .def   cas
*      .undef cas
*      which obey rules 1. and 2. above and may occur at any
*      point in a minimal program, including within a condition.
*      multiply defining a symbol is an error.
*      undefining a symbol which is not defined is not an error.
*
*      the effect is that if a symbol is currently defined,
*      then in any condition depending on it, ms1 will be
*      processed and ms2 omitted. conversely if it is undefined,
*      ms1 will be omitted and ms2 processed.
*
*      nesting of conditions is such that conditions
*      in a section not selected for processing must not be
*      evaluated. nested conditions must remember their
*      environment whilst being processed. effectively this
*      implies use of a scheme based on a stack with .if, .fi
*      matching by the condition processor of the translator.

*
*      operand formats (continued)
*
*      the following special symbols refer to a collection of
*      the listed possibilities
*
*      val  01,02                      predefined value
*
*           val is used to refer to a predefined one word
*           integer value in the range 0 le n le cfp$l.
*
*      reg  07,08                      register
*
*           reg is used to describe an operand which can be
*           any of the registers (xl,xr,xs,xt,wa,wb,wc). such
*           an operand can hold a one word integer (address).
*
*      opc  09,10,11                   character
*
*           opc is used to designate a specific character
*           operand for use in the lch and sch instructions.
*           the index register referenced must be either xr or
*           xl (not xs,xt). see section on character operations.
*
*      ops  03,04,09,12,13,14,15       memory reference
*
*           ops is used to describe an operand which is in
*           memory. the operand may be one or more words long
*           depending on the data type. in the case of multiword
*           operands, the address given is the first word.
*
*      opw  as for ops + 08,10,11      full word
*
*           opw is used to refer to an operand whose capacity is
*           that of a full memory word. opw includes all the
*           possibilities for ops (the referenced word is used)
*           plus the use of one of the three work registers
*           (wa,wb,wc). in addition, the formats (x)+ and -(x)
*           allow indexed operations in which the index register
*           is popped by one word after the reference (x)+,
*           or pushed by one word before the reference -(x)
*           these latter two formats provide a facility for
*           manipulation of stacks. the format does not imply
*           a particular direction in which stacks must build -
*           it is used for compactness. note that there is a
*           restriction which disallows an instruction to use
*           an index register in one of these formats
*           in some other manner in the same instruction.
*           e.g.   mov  xl,(xl)+   is illegal.
*           the formats -(x) and (x)+ may also be used in
*           pre-decrementation, post-incrementation to access
*           the adjacent character of a string.
       ejc
*
*      operand formats (continued)
*
*      opn  as for opw + 07            one word integer
*
*           opn is used to represent an operand location which
*           can contain a one word integer (e.g. an address).
*           this includes all the possibilities for opw plus
*           the use of one of the index registers (xl,xr,xt,
*           xs). the range of integer values is 0 le n le cfp$l.
*
*      opv  as for opn + 18-22         one word integer value
*
*           opv is used for an operand which can yield a one
*           word integer value (e.g. an address). it includes
*           all the possibilities for opn (the current value of
*           the location is used) plus the use of literals. note
*           that although the literal formats are described in
*           terms of a reference to a location containing an
*           address constant, this location may not actually
*           exist in some implementations since only the value
*           is required. a restriction is placed on literals
*           which may consist only of defined symbols and
*           certain labels. consequently small integers to be
*           used as literals must be pre-defined, a discipline
*           aiding program maintenance and revision.
*
*      addr 01,02,03,04,05             address
*
*           addr is used to describe an explicit address value
*           (one word integer value) for use with dac.

*
*      1.1  mov  opv,opn     move one word value

*           mov causes the value of operand opv to be set as
*           the new contents of operand location opn. in the
*           case where opn is not an index register, any value
*           which can normally occupy a memory word (including
*           a part of a multiword real or integer value)
*           can be transferred using mov. if the target location
*           opn is an index register, then opv must specify an
*           appropriate one word value or operand containing
*           such an appropriate value.

*      1.5  esw              end of branch switch table
*
*           bsw,iff,esw provide a capability for a switched
*           branch similar to a fortran computed goto. the
*           val on the bsw instruction is the maximum number
*           of branches. the value in x ranges from zero up to
*           but not including this maximum. each iff provides a
*           branch. val must be less than that given on the bsw
*           and control goes to plbl if the value in x matches.
*           if the value in x does not correspond to any of the
*           iff entries, then control passes to the plbl on the
*           bsw. this plbl operand may be omitted if there are
*           no values missing from the list.
*
*           iff and esw may only be used in this context.
*           execution of bsw may destroy the contents of x.
*           the iff entries may be in any order and since
*           a translator may thus need to store and sort them,
*           the comment field is restricted in length (sec 11).

*
*      1.6  ent  val         define program entry point
*
*           the symbol appearing in the label field is defined
*           to be a program entry point which can subsequently
*           be used in conjunction with the bri instruction,
*           which provides the only means of entering the
*           code. it is illegal to fall into code
*           identified by an entry point. the
*           entry symbol is assigned an address which need not
*           be a multiple of cfp$b but which must be in the
*           range 0 le cfp$l and the address must not lie within
*           the address range of the allocated data area.
*           furthermore, addresses of successive entry points
*           must be assigned in some ascending sequence so
*           that the address comparison instructions can be
*           used to test the order in which two entry points
*           occur. the symbol val gives an identifying value
*           to the entry point which can be accessed with the
*           lei instruction.
*
*           note - subject to the restriction below, val may
*           be omitted if no such identification is needed i.e.
*           if no lei references the entry point. for this
*           case, a translation optimisation is possible in
*           which no memory need be reserved for a null
*           identification which is never to be referenced, but
*           only provided this is done so as not to interfere
*           with the strictly ascending sequence of entry point

*           the stack.
*           if method (2) is used for links, error exits
*           (erb,err) from a procedure will necessitate link

*           independent of the actual implementation.
*
*           the actual form of the return point is undefined.
*           however, each word stored on the stack for an

*
*           1)               it can be handled as an address

*           pointer register is always a word address (i.e.
*           a one word integer which is a multiple of cfp$b).

*      -6-  operations on character values
*
*           character operations employ the concept of a
*           character pointer which uses either
*           index register xr or xl (not xs).
*
*           a character pointer points to a specific character
*           in a string of characters stored cfp$c chars to a
*           word. the only operations permitted on a character
*           pointer are lch and sch. in particular, a character
*           pointer may not even be moved with mov.
*
*              restriction 1.
*              --------------
*           it is important when coding in minimal to ensure
*           that no action occurring between the initial use of
*           plc or psc and the eventual clearing of xl or xr on
*           completion of character operations can initiate a
*           garbage collection. the latter of course could cause
*           the addressed characters to be moved leaving the
*           character pointers pointing to rubbish.
*
*              restriction 2.
*              --------------
*           a further restriction to be observed in code
*           handling character strings, is that strings built
*           dynamically should be right padded with zero
*           characters to a full word boundary to permit easy
*           hashing and use of ceq or cne in testing strings
*           for equality.
*
*      6.1  plc  x,opv       prepare ch ptr for lch,cmc,mvc,trc,
*                            mcb.
*
*      6.2  psc  x,opv       prepare char. ptr for sch,mvc,mcb.
*
*           opv can be omitted if it is zero.
*           the char. initially addressed is determined by the
*           word address in x and the integer offset opv.
*           there is an automatic implied offset of cfp$f bytes.
*           cfp$f is used to formally introduce into minimal a
*           value needed in translating these opcodes which,
*           since minimal itself does not prescribe a string
*           structure in detail, depends on the choice of a data
*           structure for strings in the minimal program.
*           e.g. if cfp$b = cfp$c = 3, cfp$f = 6, num01 = 1, xl
*           points to a series of 4 words, abc/def/ghi/jkl, then
*               plc  xl,=num01
*           points to h.

*
*      6.4  sch  reg,opc     store character from reg
*
*           these operations are defined such that the character
*           is right justified in register reg with zero bits to
*           the left. after lch for example, it is legitimate
*           to regard reg as containing the ordinal integer
*           corresponding to the character.
*
*           opc is one of the following three possibilities.
*

*                            character pointer is incremented
*                            to point to the next character

*

*                            character so that the previous

*           a  psc  x instruction. no more sch instructions
*           using  x  should be obeyed until another psc is
*           obeyed. it is provided solely as an efficiency aid
*           on machines without character orders since it
*           permits use of register buffering of chars in sch
*           sequences. where csc is not a no-op, it must observe
*           restriction 2. (e.g. in spitbol, alocs zeroises the
*           last word of a string frame prior to sch sequence
*           being started so csc must not nullify this action.)
*

*           on some target machines, the possibility of the sign
*           bit being set may require special action.

*           xl and xr should have been prepared by plc.
*           the translate table consists of cfp$a contiguous

*                  bnz  wa,loopw

*           the initial addresses in xr,xl are word addresses.

*      -10- operations connected with the stack
*
*      the stack is an area in memory which is dedicated for use
*      in conjunction with the stack pointer register (xs). as
*      previously described, it is used by the jsr and exi
*      instructions and may be used for storage of any other
*      data as required.
*
*      the stack builds either way in memory and an important
*      restriction is that the value in (xs) must be the address
*      of the stack front at all times since
*      some implementations may randomly destroy stack locations
*      beyond (xs).
*
*      the starting stack base address is passed
*      in (xs) at the start of execution. during execution it
*      is necessary to make sure that the stack does not
*      overflow. this is achieved by executing the following
*      instruction periodically.
*
*      10.1 chk              check stack overflow
*
*      after successfully executing chk, it is permissible to
*      use up to 100 additional words before issuing another chk
*      thus chk need not be issued every time the stack is
*      expanded. in some implementations, the checking may be
*      automatic and chk will have no effect. following the
*      above rule makes sure that the program will operate
*      correctly in implementations with no automatic check.
*
*      if stack overflow occurs (detected either automatically
*      or by a chk instruction), then control is passed to the
*      stack overflow section (see program form). note that this
*      transfer may take place following any instruction which
*      stores data at a new location on the stack.
*      after stack overflow, stack is arbitrarily popped
*      to give some space in which the error procedure may
*      operate. otherwise a loop of stack overflows may occur.

*
*      the following instructions are used to generate constant
*      values in the constant section and also to assemble
*      initial values in the working storage section. they
*      may not appear except in these two sections.
*
*      11.1 dac  addr        assemble address constant.

*      11.2 dic  integer     generates an integer value which
*                            occupies cfp$i consecutive words.
*                            the operand is a digit string with
*                            a required leading sign.
*
*      11.3 drc  real        assembles a real constant which
*                            occupies cfp$r consecutive words.
*                            the operand form must obey the
*                            rules for a fortran real constant
*                            with the extra requirement that a
*                            leading sign be present.
*
*      11.4 dtc  dtext       define text constant. dtext
*                            is started and ended with any

*                            constant occupies consecutive words
*                            as dictated by the configuration
*                            parameter cfp$c. any unused chars
*                            in the last word are right filled
*                            with zeros (i.e. the character
*                            whose internal code is zero).
*                            the string contains a sequence of
*                            letters, digits, blanks and any of
*                            the following special characters.
*                            =,$.(*)/+-
*                            no other characters
*                            may be used in a dtext operand.

*      11.5 dbc  val         assemble bit string constant. the
*                            operand is a positive integer

*
*      the following instruction is used to define symbols
*      in the definitions section. it may not be used elsewhere.
*
*      12.1 equ  eqop        define symbol
*
*           the symbol which appears in the label field is
*           defined to have the absolute value given
*           by the eqop operand. a given symbol may be defined
*           only once in this manner, and any symbols occuring
*           in eqop must be previously defined.
*
*           the following are the possibilities for eqop
*
*           val              the indicated value is used
*
*           val+val          the sum of the two values is used.

*
*      symbol definition instructions (continued)
*
*      the following instructions may be used to define symbols
*      in the procedure section. they may not be used in
*      any other part of the program.
*
*      12.2 exp              define external procedure
*
*           exp defines the symbol appearing in the label field
*           to be the name of an external procedure which can be
*           referenced in a subsequent jsr instruction. the
*           coding for the procedure is external to the
*           coding of the source program in this language.
*           the code for external procedures may be
*           referred to collectively as the operating system
*           interface, or more briefly, osint, and will
*           frequently be a separately compiled segment of code
*           loaded with spitbol to produce a complete system.
*
*      12.3 inp  ptyp,int    define internal procedure
*
*           inp defines the symbol appearing in the label field
*           to be the name of an internal procedure and gives
*           its type and number of exit parameters. the label
*           can be referenced in jsr instructions and
*           it must appear labelling a prc instruction in the
*           program section.
*
*      12.4 inr              define internal routine
*
*           inr defines the symbol appearing in the label
*           field to be the name of an internal routine. the
*           label may be referenced in any type of branch order
*           and it must appear labelling a rtn instruction in
*           the program section.

*
*           ttl implies an immediate eject of the
*           assembly listing to print the new title.
*
*           the use of ttl and ejc cards is such that the

*           as many as 58 lines per page. in the event that
*           the printer depth is less than this, or if the
*           listing contains interspersed lines (such as actual
*           generated code), then the format may be upset.

*
*           the error section contains instructions like the

*                            words at the top end with a call
*                            to a system procedure.
*
*      stack area            this region of memory holds
*                            the stack used for subroutine calls
*                            and other storage of one word
*                            integer values (addresses). this
*                            is the stack associated with
*                            index register xs.
*
*      the locations and sizes of these areas are specified
*      by the values in the registers at the start of program
*      execution as follows.
*
*      (xs)                  address one past the stack base.
*                            e.g. if xs is 23456, a d-stack will
*                            occupy words 23455,23454,...
*                            whereas a u-stack will occupy
*                            23457,23458,...
*
*      (xr)                  address of the first word
*                            in the data area
*
*      (xl)                  address of the last word in the
*                            data area.
*
*      (wa)                  initial stack pointer
*
*      (wb,wc,ia,ra,cp)      zero
*
*      there is no explicit way to terminate the execution of a

*
*      general structure
*      -----------------
*
*      this program is a translator for a version of the snobol4
*      programming language. language details are contained in
*      the manual macro spitbol by dewar and mccann, technical
*      report 90, university of leeds 1976.
*      the implementation is discussed in dewar and mccann,
*      macro spitbol - a snobol4 compiler, software practice and
*      experience, 7, 95-113, 1977.
*      the language is as implemented by the btl translator
*      (griswold, poage and polonsky, prentice hall, 1971)
*      with the following principal exceptions.
*
*      1)   redefinition of standard system functions and
*           operators is not permitted.
*
*      2)   the value function is not provided.
*
*      3)   access tracing is provided in addition to the
*           other standard trace modes.
*
*      4)   the keyword stfcount is not provided.
*
*      5)   the keyword fullscan is not provided and all pattern
*           matching takes place in fullscan mode (i.e. with no
*           heuristics applied).
*
*      6)   a series of expressions separated by commas may
*           be grouped within parentheses to provide a selection
*           capability. the semantics are that the selection
*           assumes the value of the first expression within it
*           which succeeds as they are evaluated from the left.
*           if no expression succeeds the entire statement fails
*
*      7)   an explicit pattern matching operator is provided.
*           this is the binary query (see gimpel sigplan oct 74)
*
*      8)   the assignment operator is introduced as in the
*           gimpel reference.
*
*      9)   the exit function is provided for generating load
*           modules - cf. gimpels sitbol.
*
*
*      the method used in this program is to translate the
*      source code into an internal pseudo-code (see following
*      section). an interpretor is then used to execute this
*      generated pseudo-code. the nature of the snobol4 language
*      is such that the latter task is much more complex than
*      the actual translation phase. accordingly, nearly all the
*      code in the program section is concerned with the actual
*      execution of the snobol4 program.
       ejc
*
*      interpretive code format
*      ------------------------
*
*      the interpretive pseudo-code consists of a series of
*      address pointers. the exact format of the code is
*      described in connection with the cdblk format. the
*      purpose of this section is to give general insight into
*      the interpretive approach involved.
*
*      the basic form of the code is related to reverse polish.
*      in other words, the operands precede the operators which
*      are zero address operators. there are some exceptions to
*      these rules, notably the unary not operator and the
*      selection construction which clearly require advance
*      knowledge of the operator involved.
*
*      the operands are moved to the top of the main stack and
*      the operators are applied to the top stack entries. like
*      other versions of spitbol, this processor depends on
*      knowing whether operands are required by name or by value
*      and moves the appropriate object to the stack. thus no
*      name/value checks are included in the operator circuits.
*
*      the actual pointers in the code point to a block whose
*      first word is the address of the interpretor routine
*      to be executed for the code word.
*
*      in the case of operators, the pointer is to a word which
*      contains the address of the operator to be executed. in
*      the case of operands such as constants, the pointer is to
*      the operand itself. accordingly, all operands contain
*      a field which points to the routine to load the value of
*      the operand onto the stack. in the case of a variable,
*      there are three such pointers. one to load the value,
*      one to store the value and a third to jump to the label.
*
*      the handling of failure returns deserves special comment.
*      the location flptr contains the pointer to the location
*      on the main stack which contains the failure return
*      which is in the form of a byte offset in the current
*      code block (cdblk or exblk). when a failure occurs, the
*      stack is popped as indicated by the setting of flptr and
*      control is passed to the appropriate location in the
*      current code block with the stack pointer pointing to the
*      failure offset on the stack and flptr unchanged.
       ejc
*
*      internal data representations
*      -----------------------------
*
*      representation of values
*
*      a value is represented by a pointer to a block which
*      describes the type and particulars of the data value.
*      in general, a variable is a location containing such a
*      pointer (although in the case of trace associations this
*      is modified, see description of trblk).
*
*      the following is a list of possible datatypes showing the
*      type of block used to hold the value. the details of
*      each block format are given later.
*
*      datatype              block type
*      --------              ----------
*
*      array                 arblk or vcblk
*
*      code                  cdblk
*
*      expression            exblk or seblk
*
*      integer               icblk
*
*      name                  nmblk
*
*      pattern               p0blk or p1blk or p2blk
*
*      real                  rcblk
*
*      string                scblk
*
*      table                 tbblk
*
*      program datatype      pdblk
       ejc
*
*      representation of variables
*      ---------------------------
*
*      during the course of evaluating expressions, it is
*      necessary to generate names of variables (for example
*      on the left side of a binary equals operator). these are
*      not to be confused with objects of datatype name which
*      are in fact values.
*
*      from a logical point of view, such names could be simply
*      represented by a pointer to the appropriate value cell.
*      however in the case of arrays and program defined
*      datatypes, this would violate the rule that there must be
*      no pointers into the middle of a block in dynamic store.
*      accordingly, a name is always represented by a base and
*      offset. the base points to the start of the block
*      containing the variable value and the offset is the
*      offset within this block in bytes. thus the address
*      of the actual variable is determined by adding the base
*      and offset values.
*
*      the following are the instances of variables represented
*      in this manner.
*
*      1)   natural variable base is ptr to vrblk
*                            offset is *vrval
*
*      2)   table element    base is ptr to teblk
*                            offset is *teval
*
*      3)   array element    base is ptr to arblk
*                            offset is offset to element
*
*      4)   vector element   base is ptr to vcblk
*                            offset is offset to element
*
*      5)   prog def dtp     base is ptr to pdblk
*                            offset is offset to field value
*
*      in addition there are two cases of objects which are
*      like variables but cannot be handled in this manner.
*      these are called pseudo-variables and are represented
*      with a special base pointer as follows=
*
*      expression variable   ptr to evblk (see evblk)
*
*      keyword variable      ptr to kvblk (see kvblk)
*
*      pseudo-variables are handled as special cases by the
*      access procedure (acess) and the assignment procedure
*      (asign). see these two procedures for details.
       ejc
*
*      organization of data area
*      -------------------------
*
*      the data area is divided into two regions.
*
*      static area
*
*      the static area builds up from the bottom and contains
*      data areas which are allocated dynamically but are never
*      deleted or moved around. the macro-program itself
*      uses the static area for the following.
*
*      1)   all variable blocks (vrblk).
*
*      2)   the hash table for variable blocks.
*
*      3)   miscellaneous buffers and work areas (see program
*           initialization section).
*
*      in addition, the system procedures may use this area for
*      input/output buffers, external functions etc. space in
*      the static region is allocated by calling procedure alost
*
*      the following global variables define the current
*      location and size of the static area.
*
*      statb                 address of start of static area
*      state                 address+1 of last word in area.
*
*      the minimum size of static is given approximately by
*           12 + *e$hnb + *e$sts + space for alphabet string
*           and standard print buffer.
       ejc
*      dynamic area
*
*      the dynamic area is built upwards in memory after the
*      static region. data in this area must all be in standard
*      block formats so that it can be processed by the garbage
*      collector (procedure gbcol). gbcol compacts blocks down
*      in this region as required by space exhaustion and can
*      also move all blocks up to allow for expansion of the
*      static region.
*      with the exception of tables and arrays, no spitbol
*      object once built in dynamic memory is ever subsequently
*      modified. observing this rule necessitates a copying
*      action during string and pattern concatenation.
*
*      garbage collection is fundamental to the allocation of
*      space for values. spitbol uses a very efficient garbage
*      collector which insists that pointers into dynamic store
*      should be identifiable without use of bit tables,
*      marker bits etc. to satisfy this requirement, dynamic
*      memory must not start at too low an address and lengths
*      of arrays, tables, strings, code and expression blocks
*      may not exceed the numerical value of the lowest dynamic
*      address.
*
*      to avoid either penalizing users with modest
*      requirements or restricting those with greater needs on
*      host systems where dynamic memory is allocated in low
*      addresses, the minimum dynamic address may be specified
*      sufficiently high to permit arbitrarily large spitbol
*      objects to be created (with the possibility in extreme
*      cases of wasting large amounts of memory below the
*      start address). this minimum value is made available
*      in variable mxlen by a system routine, sysmx.
*      alternatively sysmx may indicate that a
*      default may be used in which dynamic is placed
*      at the lowest possible address following static.
*
*      the following global work cells define the location and
*      length of the dynamic area.
*
*      dnamb                 start of dynamic area
*      dnamp                 next available location
*      dname                 last available location + 1
*
*      dnamb is always higher than state since the alost
*      procedure maintains some expansion space above state.
*      *** dnamb must never be permitted to have a value less
*      than that in mxlen ***
*
*      space in the dynamic region is allocated by the alloc
*      procedure. the dynamic region may be used by system
*      procedures provided that all the rules are obeyed.
*      some of the rules are subtle so it is preferable for
*      osint to manage its own memory needs. spitbol procs
*      obey rules to ensure that no action can cause a garbage
*      collection except at such times as contents of xl, xr
*      and the stack are +clean+ (see comment before utility
*      procedures and in gbcol for more detail). note
*      that calls of alost may cause garbage collection (shift
*      of memory to free space). spitbol procs which call
*      system routines assume that they cannot precipitate
*      collection and this must be respected.
       ejc
*
*      register usage
*      --------------
*
*      (cp)                  code pointer register. used to
*                            hold a pointer to the current
*                            location in the interpretive pseudo
*                            code (i.e. ptr into a cdblk).
*
*      (xl,xr)               general index registers. usually
*                            used to hold pointers to blocks in
*                            dynamic storage. an important
*                            restriction is that the value in
*                            xl must be collectable for
*                            a garbage collect call. a value
*                            is collectable if it either points
*                            outside the dynamic area, or if it
*                            points to the start of a block in
*                            the dynamic area.
*
*      (xs)                  stack pointer. used to point to
*                            the stack front. the stack may
*                            build up or down and is used
*                            to stack subroutine return points
*                            and other recursively saved data.
*
*      (xt)                  an alternative name for xl during
*                            its use in accessing stacked items.
*
*      (wa,wb,wc)            general work registers. cannot be
*                            used for indexing, but may hold
*                            various types of data.
*
*      (ia)                  used for all signed integer
*                            arithmetic, both that used by the
*                            translator and that arising from
*                            use of snobol4 arithmetic operators
*
*      (ra)                  real accumulator. used for all
*                            floating point arithmetic.
       ejc

*      spitbol conditional assembly symbols
*      ------------------------------------
*
*      in the spitbol translator, the following conditional
*      assembly symbols are referred to. to incorporate the
*      features referred to, the minimal source should be
*      prefaced by suitable conditional assembly symbol
*      definitions.
*      in all cases it is permissible to default the definitions
*      in which case the additional features will be omitted

       ttl  s p i t b o l -- procedures section
*
*      this section starts with descriptions of the operating
*      system dependent procedures which are used by the spitbol
*      translator. all such procedures have five letter names
*      beginning with sys. they are listed in alphabetical
*      order.
*      all procedures have a  specification consisting of a
*      model call, preceded by a possibly empty list of register
*      contents giving parameters available to the procedure and
*      followed by a possibly empty list of register contents
*      required on return from the call or which may have had
*      their contents destroyed. only those registers explicitly
*      mentioned in the list after the call may have their
*      values changed.
*      the segment of code providing the external procedures is
*      conveniently referred to as osint (operating system
*      interface). the sysxx procedures it contains provide
*      facilities not usually available as primitives in
*      assembly languages. for particular target machines,
*      implementors may choose for some minimal opcodes which
*      do not have reasonably direct translations, to use calls
*      of additional procedures which they provide in osint.
*      e.g. mwb or trc might be translated as jsr sysmb,
*      jsr systc in some implementations.
*
*      in the descriptions, reference is made to --blk
*      formats (-- = a pair of letters). see the spitbol
*      definitions section for detailed descriptions of all
*      such block formats except fcblk for which sysfc should
*      be consulted.
*
*      section 0 contains inp,inr specifications of internal
*      procedures,routines. this gives a single pass translator
*      information making it easy to generate alternative calls
*      in the translation of jsr-s for procedures of different
*      types if this proves necessary.

*      if the conditional assembly symbol .cbsp is defined.
*      the meaning is system dependent.  in general, backspace
*      repositions the file one record closer to the beginning

*      operate on the previous record.

*      (xr)                  result returned
*
*      the arguments are stored on the stack with
*      the last argument at 0(xs). on return, xs
*      is popped past the arguments.
*
*      the form of the arguments as passed is that used in the
*      spitbol translator (see definitions and data structures
*      section). the control block format is also described
*      (under efblk) in this section.
*
*      there are two ways of returning a result.
*
*      1)   return a pointer to a block in dynamic storage. this
*           block must be in exactly correct format, including
*           the first word. only functions written with intimate
*           knowledge of the system will return in this way.
*
*      2)   string, integer and real results may be returned by
*           pointing to a pseudo-block outside dynamic memory.
*           this block is in icblk, rcblk or scblk format except
*           that the first word will be overwritten
*           by a type word on return and so need not
*           be correctly set. such a result is
*           copied into main storage before proceeding.
*           unconverted results may similarly be returned in a
*           pseudo-block which is in correct format including
*           type word recognisable by garbage collector since
*           block is copied into dynamic memory.

*      sysfc -- file control block routine
*
sysfc  exp                   define external entry point
*
*      see also sysio
*      input and output have 3 arguments referred to as shown
*           input(variable name,file arg1,file arg2)
*           output(variable name,file arg1,file arg2)
*      file arg1 may be an integer or string used to identify
*      an i/o channel. it is converted to a string for checking.
*      the exact significance of file arg2
*      is not rigorously prescribed but to improve portability,
*      the scheme described in the spitbol user manual
*      should be adopted when possible. the preferred form is
*      a string $f$,r$r$,c$c$,i$i$,...,z$z$  where
*      $f$ is an optional file name which is placed first.
*       remaining items may be omitted or included in any order.
*      $r$ is maximum record length
*      $c$ is a carriage control character or character string
*      $i$ is some form of channel identification used in the
*         absence of $f$ to associate the variable
*         with a file allocated dynamically by jcl commands at
*         spitbol load time.
*      ,...,z$z$ are additional fields.
*      if , (comma) cannot be used as a delimiter, .ciod
*      should be defined to introduce by conditional assembly
*      another delimiter (see
*        iodel  equ  *
*      early in definitions section).
*      sysfc is called when a variable is input or output
*      associated to check file arg1 and file arg2 and
*      to  report whether an fcblk (file control
*      block) is necessary and if so what size it should be.
*      this makes it possible for spitbol rather than osint to
*      allocate such a block in dynamic memory if required
*      or alternatively in static memory.
*      the significance of an fcblk , if one is requested, is
*      entirely up to the system interface. the only restriction
*      is that if the fcblk should appear to lie in dynamic
*      memory, pointers to it should be proper pointers to
*      the start of a recognisable and garbage collectable
*      block (this condition will be met if sysfc requests
*      spitbol to provide an fcblk).
*      an option is provided for osint to return a pointer in
*      xl to an fcblk which it privately allocated. this ptr
*      will be made available when i/o occurs later.
*      private fcblks may have arbitrary contents and spitbol
*      stores nothing in them.
       ejc
*      the requested size for an fcblk in dynamic memory
*      should allow a 2 word overhead for block type and
*      length fields. information subsequently stored in the
*      remaining words may be arbitrary if an xnblk (external
*      non-relocatable block) is requested. if the request is
*      for an xrblk (external relocatable block) the
*      contents of words should be collectable (i.e. any
*      apparent pointers into dynamic should be genuine block
*      pointers). these restrictions do not apply if an fcblk
*      is allocated outside dynamic or is not allocated at all.
*      if an fcblk is requested, its fields will be initialised
*      to zero before entry to sysio with the exception of
*      words 0 and 1 in which the block type and length
*      fields are placed for fcblks in dynamic memory only.
*      for the possible use of sysej and sysxi, if fcblks
*      are used, a chain is built so that they may all be
*      found - see sysxi for details.
*      if both file arg1 and file arg2 are null, calls of sysfc
*      and sysio are omitted.
*      if file arg1 is null (standard input/output file), sysfc
*      is called to check non-null file arg2 but any request
*      for an fcblk will be ignored, since spitbol handles the
*      standard files specially and cannot readily keep fcblk
*      pointers for them.
*      filearg1 is type checked by spitbol so further checking
*      may be unneccessary in many implementations.
*      file arg2 is passed so that sysfc may analyse and
*      check it. however to assist in this, spitbol also passes
*      on the stack the components of this argument with
*      file name, $f$ (otherwise null) extracted and stacked
*      first.
*      the other fields, if any, are extracted as substrings,
*      pointers to them are stacked and a count of all items
*      stacked is placed in wc. if an fcblk was earlier
*      allocated and pointed to via file arg1, sysfc is also
*      passed a pointer to this fcblk.

*      the spitbol program is essentially independent of

*      these parameters may require tuning for a given version
*      the values given in comments have been successfully used.
*
*      e$srs is the number of words to reserve at the end of
*      storage for end of run processing. it should be
*      set as small as possible without causing memory overflow
*      in critical situations (e.g. memory overflow termination)
*      and should thus reserve sufficient space at least for
*      an scblk containing say 30 characters.
*
e$srs  equ  *                30 words
*
*      e$sts is the number of words grabbed in a chunk when
*      storage is allocated in the static region. the minimum
*      permitted value is 256/cfp$b. larger values will lead
*      to increased efficiency at the cost of wasting memory.
*
e$sts  equ  *                500 words
*
*      e$cbs is the size of code block allocated initially and
*      the expansion increment if overflow occurs. if this value
*      is too small or too large, excessive garbage collections
*      will occur during compilation and memory may be lost
*      in the case of a too large value.
*
e$cbs  equ  *                500 words
*
*      e$hnb is the number of bucket headers in the variable
*      hash table. it should always be odd. larger values will
*      speed up compilation and indirect references at the
*      expense of additional storage for the hash table itself.
*
e$hnb  equ  *                127 bucket headers
*
*      e$hnw is the maximum number of words of a string
*      name which participate in the string hash algorithm.
*      larger values give a better hash at the expense of taking
*      longer to compute the hash. there is some optimal value.

e$hnw  equ  *                6 words

*      collection is small compared to the total amount of space
*      in use garbage collector thrashing is likely to occur as
*      this space is used up.  e$fsp is a measure of the

*      data block formats and definitions
*
*      the following sections describe the detailed format of
*      all possible data blocks in static and dynamic memory.
*
*      every block has a name of the form xxblk where xx is a
*      unique two character identifier. the first word of every
*      block must contain a pointer to a program location in the
*      interpretor which is immediately preceded by an address
*      constant containing the value bl$xx where xx is the block
*      identifier. this provides a uniform mechanism for
*      distinguishing between the various block types.
*
*      in some cases, the contents of the first word is constant
*      for a given block type and merely serves as a pointer
*      to the identifying address constant. however, in other
*      cases there are several possibilities for the first
*      word in which case each of the several program entry
*      points must be preceded by the appropriate constant.
*
*      in each block, some of the fields are relocatable. this
*      means that they may contain a pointer to another block
*      in the dynamic area. (to be more precise, if they contain
*      a pointer within the dynamic area, then it is a pointer
*      to a block). such fields must be modified by the garbage
*      collector (procedure gbcol) whenever blocks are compacted
*      in the dynamic region. the garbage collector (actually
*      procedure gbcpf) requires that all such relocatable
*      fields in a block must be contiguous.
       ejc
*
*      the description format uses the following scheme.
*
*      1)   block title and two character identifier
*
*      2)   description of basic use of block and indication
*           of circumstances under which it is constructed.
*
*      3)   picture of the block format. in these pictures low
*           memory addresses are at the top of the page. fixed
*           length fields are surrounded by i (letter i). fields
*           which are fixed length but whose length is dependent
*           on a configuration parameter are surrounded by *
*           (asterisk). variable length fields are surrounded
*           by / (slash).
*
*      4)   definition of symbolic offsets to fields in
*           block and of the size of the block if fixed length
*           or of the size of the fixed length fields if the
*           block is variable length.
*           note that some routines such as gbcpf assume
*           certain offsets are equal. the definitions
*           given here enforce this.  make changes to
*           them only with due care.

*      5)   detailed comments on the significance and formats
*           of the various fields.
*
*      the order is alphabetical by identification code.
       ejc
*
*      definitions of block codes
*
*      this table provides a unique identification code for
*      each separate block type. the first word of a block in
*      the dynamic area always contains the address of a program
*      entry point. the block code is used as the entry point id
*      the order of these codes dictates the order of the table
*      used by the datatype function (scnmt in the constant sec)
*
*      block codes for accessible datatypes
*
*      note that real and buffer types are always included, even
*      if they are conditionally excluded elsewhere.  this main-
*      tains block type codes across all versions of spitbol,
*      providing consistancy for external functions.  but note
*      that the bcblk is out of alphabetic order, placed at the
*      end of the list so as not to change the block type
*      ordering in use in existing external functions.

*      field references
*
*      references to the fields of data blocks are symbolic
*      (i.e. use the symbolic offsets) with the following
*      exceptions.
*
*      1)   references to the first word are usually not
*           symbolic since they use the (x) operand format.
*
*      2)   the code which constructs a block is often not
*           symbolic and should be changed if the corresponding
*           block format is modified.
*
*      3)   the plc and psc instructions imply an offset
*           corresponding to the definition of cfp$f.
*
*      4)   there are non-symbolic references (easily changed)
*           in the garbage collector (procedures gbcpf, blkln).
*
*      5)   the fields idval, fargs appear in several blocks
*           and any changes must be made in parallel to all
*           blocks containing the fields. the actual references
*           to these fields are symbolic with the above
*           listed exceptions.
*
*      6)   several spots in the code assume that the
*           definitions of the fields vrval, teval, trnxt are
*           the same (these are sections of code which search
*           out along a trblk chain from a variable).
*
*      7)   references to the fields of an array block in the
*           array reference routine arref are non-symbolic.
*
*      apart from the exceptions listed, references are symbolic
*      as far as possible and modifying the order or number
*      of fields will not require changes.

fargs  equ  1                number of arguments
*
*      fcode is a pointer to the location in the interpretor
*      program which processes this type of function call.
*
*      fargs is the expected number of arguments. the actual
*      number of arguments is adjusted to this amount by
*      deleting extra arguments or supplying trailing nulls
*      for missing ones before transferring though fcode.
*      a value of 999 may be used in this field to indicate a
*      variable number of arguments (see svblk field svnar).

*
*      an array block represents an array value other than one

*
*      a bcblk is an indirect control header for bfblk.
*      the reason for not storing this data directly
*      in the related bfblk is so that the bfblk can
*      maintain the same skeletal structure as an scblk
*      thus facilitating transparent string operations
*      (for the most part).  specifically, cfp$f is the
*      same for a bfblk as for an scblk.  by convention,
*      whereever a buffer value is employed, the bcblk
*      is pointed to.
*
*      the corresponding bfblk is pointed to by the
*      bcbuf pointer in the bcblk.

*      note that the offset to the characters of the string
*      is given by cfp$f, as with an scblk.  however, the
*      offset which is occupied by the length for an scblk
*      is the total char space for bfblks, and routines which

*
*      code block (continued)
*
*      now we consider the overall structure of the code block
*      for a statement with possible goto fields.
*
*      first comes the code for the statement body.
*      the statement body is an expression to be evaluated
*      by value although the value is not actually required.
*      normal value code is generated for the body of the
*      statement except in the case of a pattern match by
*      value, in which case the following is generated.
*
*                            value code for left operand
*                            value code for right operand
*                            =o$pms
*
*      next we have the code for the success goto. there are
*      several cases as follows.
*
*      1)   no success goto  ptr to cdblk for next statement
*
*      2)   simple label     ptr to vrtra field of vrblk
*
*      3)   complex goto     (code by name for goto operand)
*                            =o$goc
*
*      4)   direct goto      (code by value for goto operand)
*                            =o$god
*
*      following this we generate code for the failure goto if
*      it is direct or if it is complex, simple failure gotos
*      having been handled by an appropriate setting of the
*      cdfal field of the cdblk. the generated code is one
*      of the following.
*
*      1)   complex fgoto    =o$fif
*                            =o$gof
*                            name code for goto operand
*                            =o$goc
*
*      2)   direct fgoto     =o$fif
*                            =o$gof
*                            value code for goto operand
*                            =o$god
*
*      an optimization occurs if the success and failure gotos
*      are identical and either complex or direct. in this case,
*      no code is generated for the success goto and control
*      is allowed to fall into the failure goto on success.

*      of a program defined datatype object. a call to the
*      system function data builds a dfblk for the datatype name
*
*      note that these blocks are built in static because pdblk
*      length is got from dflen field.  if dfblk was in dynamic
*      store this would cause trouble during pass two of garbage
*      collection.  scblk referred to by dfnam field is also put
*      in static so that there are no reloc. fields. this cuts
*      garbage collection task appreciably for pdblks which are
*      likely to be present in large numbers.

*
*      the contents of the dvtyp field is copied into the cmtyp
*      field of the cmblk for the operator if it is used.
*
*      the cmopn field of an operator cmblk points to the dvblk
*      itself, providing the required entry address pointer ptr.
*
*      for normally undefined operators, the dvopn (and cmopn)
*      fields contain a word offset from r$uba of the function
*      block pointer for the operator (instead of o$xxx ptr).
*      for certain special operators, the dvopn field is not
*      required at all and is assembled as zero.
*
*      the left precedence is used in comparing an operator to
*      the left of some other operator. it therefore governs the
*      precedence of the operator towards its right operand.
*
*      the right precedence is used in comparing an operator to
*      the right of some other operator. it therefore governs
*      the precedence of the operator towards its left operand.
*
*      higher precedence values correspond to a tighter binding
*      capability. thus we have the left precedence lower
*      (higher) than the right precedence for right (left)
*      associative binary operators.
*
*      the left precedence of unary operators is set to an
*      arbitrary high value. the right value is not required and
*      consequently the dvrpr field is omitted for unary ops.

*
*      the table block is a hash table which points to chains
*      of table element blocks representing the elements
*      in the table which hash into the same bucket.
*
*      tbbuk entries either point to the first teblk on the

*
*      the working storage section contains areas which are
*      changed during execution of the program. the value
*      assembled is the initial value before execution starts.
*
*      all these areas are fixed length areas. variable length
*      data is stored in the static or dynamic regions of the
*      allocated data areas.
*
*      the values in this area are described either as work
*      areas or as global values. a work area is used in an
*      ephemeral manner and the value is not saved from one
*      entry into a routine to another. a global value is a
*      less temporary location whose value is saved from one
*      call to another.
*
*      w$aaa marks the start of the working section whilst
*      w$yyy marks its end.  g$aaa marks the division between
*      temporary and global values.
*
*      global values are further subdivided to facilitate
*      processing by the garbage collector. r$aaa through
*      r$yyy are global values that may point into dynamic
*      storage and hence must be relocated after each garbage
*      collection.  they also serve as root pointers to all
*      allocated data that must be preserved.  pointers between
*      a$aaa and r$aaa may point into code, static storage,
*      or mark the limits of dynamic memory.  these pointers
*      must be adjusted when the working section is saved to a
*      file and subsequently reloaded at a different address.
*
*      a general part of the approach in this program is not
*      to overlap work areas between procedures even though a
*      small amount of space could be saved. such overlap is
*      considered a source of program errors and decreases the
*      information left behind after a system crash of any kind.
*
*      the names of these locations are labels with five letter
*      (a-y,$) names. as far as possible the order is kept
*      alphabetical by these names but in some cases there
*      are slight departures caused by other order requirements.
*
*      unless otherwise documented, the order of work areas
*      does not affect the execution of the spitbol program.

*      when a save file is reloaded, these pointers must
*      be adjusted if static or dynamic memory is now
*      at a different address.  see routine reloc for
*      additional information.
*
*      some values cannot be move here because of adjacency
*      constraints.  they are handled specially by reloc et al.
*      these values are kvrtn,

*      values flprt, flptr, gtcef, and stbas point into the
*      stack and are explicitly adjusted by osint's restart

*      this section includes all routines which can be accessed

*
*      all routines in this section start with a label of the
*      form o$xxx where xxx is three letters. the generated code
*      contains a pointer to the appropriate entry label.
*
*      since the general form of the generated code consists of
*      pointers to blocks whose first word is the address of the
*      actual entry point label (o$xxx).
*
*      these routines are in alphabetical order by their
*      entry label names (i.e. by the xxx of the o$xxx name)
*
*      these routines receive control as follows
*
*      (cp)                  pointer to next code word

*
*      the first word of every block in dynamic storage and the
*      vrget, vrsto and vrtra fields of a vrblk contain a
*      pointer to an entry point in the program. all such entry
*      points are in the following section except those for
*      pattern blocks which are in the pattern matching segment
*      later on (labels of the form p$xxx), and dope vectors
*      (d$xxx) which are in the dope vector section following
*      the pattern routines (dope vectors are used for cmblks).
*
*      the entry points in this section have labels of the
*      form b$xxy where xx is the two character block type for
*      the corresponding block and y is any letter.
*
*      in some cases, the pointers serve no other purpose than
*      to identify the block type. in this case the routine
*      is never executed and thus no code is assembled.
*
*      for each of these entry points corresponding to a block
*      an entry point identification is assembled (bl$xx).
*
*      the exact entry conditions depend on the manner in
*      which the routine is accessed and are documented with
*      the individual routines as required.
*
*      the order of these routines is alphabetical with the
*      following exceptions.
*
*      the routines for seblk and exblk entries occur first so
*      that expressions can be quickly identified from the fact
*      that their routines lie before the symbol b$e$$.
*
*      these are immediately followed by the routine for a trblk
*      so that the test against the symbol b$t$$ checks for
*      trapped values or expression values (see procedure evalp)
*
*      the pattern routines lie after this section so that
*      patterns are identified with routines starting at or
*      after the initial instruction in these routines (p$aaa).
*
*      the symbol b$aaa defines the first location for block
*      routines and the symbol p$yyy (at the end of the pattern
*      match routines section) defines the last such entry point

*
*      description of algorithm
*
*      a pattern structure is represented as a linked graph
*      of nodes with the following structure.
*
*           +------------------------------------+
*           i                pcode               i
*           +------------------------------------+
*           i                pthen               i
*           +------------------------------------+
*           i                parm1               i
*           +------------------------------------+
*           i                parm2               i
*           +------------------------------------+
*
*      pcode is a pointer to the routine which will perform
*      the match of this particular node type.
*
*      pthen is a pointer to the successor node. i.e. the node
*      to be matched if the attempt to match this node succeeds.
*      if this is the last node of the pattern pthen points
*      to the dummy node ndnth which initiates pattern exit.
*
*      parm1, parm2 are parameters whose use varies with the
*      particular node. they are only present if required.
*
*      alternatives are handled with the special alternative
*      node whose parameter points to the node to be matched
*      if there is a failure on the successor path.
*
*      the following example illustrates the manner in which
*      the structure is built up. the pattern is
*
*      (a / b / c) (d / e)   where / is alternation
*
*      in the diagram, the node marked + represents an
*      alternative node and the dotted line from a + node
*      represents the parameter pointer to the alternative.
*
*      +---+     +---+     +---+     +---+
*      i + i-----i a i-----i + i-----i d i-----
*      +---+     +---+  i  +---+     +---+
*        .              i    .

*      i + i-----i b i--i  i e i-----

*        .              i
*        .              i
*      +---+            i
*      i c i------------i
*      +---+
       ejc
*
*      during the match, the registers are used as follows.
*
*      (xr)                  points to the current node
*      (xl)                  scratch
*      (xs)                  main stack pointer
*      (wb)                  cursor (number of chars matched)
*      (wa,wc)               scratch
*
*      to keep track of alternatives, the main stack is used as
*      a history stack and contains two word entries.
*
*      word 1                saved cursor value
*      word 2                node to match on failure
*
*      when a failure occurs, the most recent entry on this
*      stack is popped off to restore the cursor and point
*      to the node to be matched as an alternative. the entry
*      at the bottom of the stack points to the following
*      special nodes depending on the scan mode.
*
*      anchored mode         the bottom entry points to the
*                            special node ndabo which causes an
*                            abort. the cursor value stored
*                            with this entry is always zero.
*
*      unanchored mode       the bottom entry points to the
*                            special node nduna which moves the
*                            anchor point and restarts the match
*                            the cursor saved with this entry
*                            is the number of characters which
*                            lie before the initial anchor point
*                            (i.e. the number of anchor moves).
*                            this entry is three words long and
*                            also contains the initial pattern.
*
*      entries are made on this history stack by alternative
*      nodes and by some special compound patterns as described
*      later on. the following global locations are used during
*      pattern matching.
*
*      r$pms                 pointer to subject string
*      pmssl                 length of subject string
*      pmdfl                 flag set non-zero for dot patterns
*      pmhbs                 base ptr for current history stack
*
*      the following exit points are available to match routines
*
*      succp                 success in matching current node
*      failp                 failure in matching current node
       ejc
*
*      compound patterns
*
*      some patterns have implicit alternatives and their
*      representation in the pattern structure consists of a
*      linked set of nodes as indicated by these diagrams.
*
*      as before, the + represents an alternative node and
*      the dotted line from a + node is the parameter pointer
*      to the alternative pattern.

*           +---+            (unless optimization has occurred)
*
*      structure and execution of this pattern resemble those of
*      recursive pattern matching and immediate assignment.
*      the alternative node at the head of the structure matches
*      null initially but on subsequent failure ensures attempt
*      to match the argument.  before the argument is matched
*      p$aba stacks the cursor, pmhbs and a ptr to p$abb.  if
*      the argument cant be matched , p$abb removes this special
*      stack entry and fails.
*      if argument is matched , p$abc restores the outer pmhbs
*      value (saved by p$aba) .  then if the argument has left

*      head of the structure , ensuring a possible extra attempt
*      to match the arg if necessary.  if not , the successor to

*           +---+            this node (p$paa) saves the current
*           i a i            cursor and a pointer to the

*             i
*           +---+            this is the structure for the

*             i
*           +---+            this node (p$pac) saves the cursor,

*           +---+            and a ptr to ndpad on the stack.
*
*
*      the function of the match routine for ndpab (p$pab)
*      is simply to unstack itself and fail back onto the stack.
*
*      the match routine for p$pac also sets the global pattern
*      flag pmdfl non-zero to indicate that pattern assignments
*      may have occured in the pattern match
*
*      if pmdfl is set at the end of the match (see p$nth), the
*      history stack is scanned for matching ndpab-ndpad pairs
*      and the corresponding pattern assignments are executed.
*
*      the function of the match routine for ndpad (p$pad)
*      is simply to remove its entry from the stack and fail.
*      this includes removing the special node pointer stored
*      in addition to the standard two entries on the stack.

*             i

*           i c i            history stack ptr saved in p$fna,
*           +---+            and stacks the inner stack base
*                            ptr and a pointer to ndfnd on the
*                            stack.
*
*      ndfnb (f$fnb) simply is the failure exit for pattern
*      argument failure, and it pops itself and fails onto the
*      stack.
*
*      the match routine p$fnc allows for an optimization when
*      the fence pattern leaves no alternatives.  in this case,
*      the ndfnb entry is popped, and the match continues.
*
*      ndfnd (p$fnd) is entered when the pattern fails after
*      going through a non-optimized p$fnc, and it pops the
*      stack back past the innter stack base created by p$fna

*
*      compound patterns (continued)
*
*      expression patterns (recursive pattern matches)
*      -----------------------------------------------
*
*      initial entry for a pattern node is to the routine p$exa.
*      if the evaluated result of the expression is itself a
*      pattern, then the following steps are taken to arrange
*      for proper recursive processing.
*
*      1)   a pointer to the current node (the p$exa node) is
*           stored on the history stack with a dummy cursor.
*
*      2)   a special history stack entry is made in which the
*           node pointer points to ndexb, and the cursor value
*           is the saved value of pmhbs on entry to this node.
*           the match routine for ndexb (p$exb) restores pmhbs
*           from this cursor entry, pops off the p$exa node
*           pointer and fails.
*
*      3)   the resulting history stack pointer is saved in
*           pmhbs to establish a new level of history stack.
*
*      after matching a pattern, the end of match routine gets
*      control (p$nth). this routine proceeds as follows.
*
*      1)   load the current value of pmhbs and recognize the
*           outer level case by the fact that the associated
*           cursor in this case is the pattern match type code
*           which is less than 3. terminate the match in this
*           case and continue execution of the program.
*
*      2)   otherwise make a special history stack entry in
*           which the node pointer points to the special node
*           ndexc and the cursor is the current value of pmhbs.
*           the match routine for ndexc (p$exc) resets pmhbs to
*           this (inner) value and and then fails.
*
*      3)   using the history stack entry made on starting the
*           expression (accessible with the current value of
*           pmhbs), restore the p$exa node pointer and the old
*           pmhbs setting. take the successor and continue.
*
*      an optimization is possible if the expression pattern
*      makes no entries on the history stack. in this case,
*      instead of building the p$exc node in step 2, it is more
*      efficient to simply pop off the p$exb entry and its
*      associated node pointer. the effect is the same.

*
*           +---+            this node (p$ima) stacks the cursor
*           i a i            pmhbs and a ptr to ndimb and resets
*           +---+            the stack ptr pmhbs.
*             i
*             i
*           +---+            this is the left structure for the
*           i x i            pattern left argument of the
*           +---+            immediate assignment call.

*             i
*           +---+            this node (p$imc) performs the
*           i c i-----       assignment, pops pmhbs and stacks
*           +---+            the old pmhbs and a ptr to ndimd.
*
*
*      the structure and execution of this pattern are similar
*      to those of the recursive expression pattern matching.
*
*      the match routine for ndimb (p$imb) restores the outer
*      level value of pmhbs, unstacks the saved cursor and fails
*
*      the match routine p$imc uses the current value of pmhbs
*      to locate the p$imb entry. this entry is used to make
*      the assignment and restore the outer level value of
*      pmhbs. finally, the inner level value of pmhbs and a
*      pointer to the special node ndimd are stacked.
*
*      the match routine for ndimd (p$imd) restores the inner
*      level value of pmhbs and fails back into the stack.
*
*      an optimization occurs if the inner pattern makes no
*      entries on the history stack. in this case, p$imc pops
*      the p$imb entry instead of making a p$imd entry.

*
*      the following section contains coding for functions
*      which are predefined and available at the snobol level.
*
*      these routines receive control directly from the code or
*      indirectly through the o$fnc, o$fns or cfunc routines.
*      in both cases the conditions on entry are as follows
*
*      the arguments are on the stack. the number of arguments
*      has been adjusted to correspond to the svblk svnar field.
*
*      in certain functions the direct call is not permitted
*      and in these instances we also have.
*
*      (wa)                  actual number of arguments in call
*
*      control returns by placing the function result value on
*      on the stack and continuing execution with the next
*      word from the generated code.
*
*      the names of the entry points of these functions are of
*      the form s$xxx where xxx is the three letter code for
*      the system variable name. the functions are in order
*      alphabetically by their entry names.

*      they are not in procedure form and they do not return
*      to their callers. they are accessed with a branch type
*      instruction after setting the registers to appropriate
*      parameter values.
*
*      the register values required for each routine are
*      documented at the start of each routine. registers not
*      mentioned may contain any values except that xr,xl
*      can only contain proper collectable pointers.
*
*      some of these routines will tolerate garbage pointers
*      in xl,xr on entry. this is always documented and in
*      each case, the routine clears these garbage values before
*      exiting after completing its task.
*
*      the routines have names consisting of five letters
*      and are assembled in alphabetical order.

*
*      the following section contains procedures which are
*      used for various purposes throughout the system.
*
*      each procedure is preceded by a description of the
*      calling sequence. usually the arguments are in registers
*      but arguments can also occur on the stack and as
*      parameters assembled after the jsr instruction.
*
*      the following considerations apply to these descriptions.
*
*      1)   the stack pointer (xs) is not changed unless the
*           change is explicitly documented in the call.
*
*      2)   registers whose entry values are not mentioned
*           may contain any value except that xl,xr may only
*           contain proper (collectable) pointer values.
*           this condition on means that the called routine
*           may if it chooses preserve xl,xr by stacking.
*
*      3)   registers not mentioned on exit contain the same
*           values as they did on entry except that values in
*           xr,xl may have been relocated by the collector.
*
*      4)   registers which are destroyed on exit may contain
*           any value except that values in xl,xr are proper
*           (collectable) pointers.
*
*      5)   the code pointer register points to the current
*           code location on entry and is unchanged on exit.
*
*      in the above description, a collectable pointer is one
*      which either points outside the dynamic region or
*      points to the start of a block in the dynamic region.
*
*      in those cases where the calling sequence contains
*      parameters which are used as alternate return points,
*      these parameters may be replaced by error codes
*      assembled with the err instruction. this will result
*      in the posting of the error if the return is taken.
*
*      the procedures all have names consisting of five letters
*      and are in alphabetical order by their names.

*      evalp -- evaluate expression during pattern match
*
*      evalp is used to evaluate an expression (by value) during
*      a pattern match. the effect is like evalx, but pattern
*      variables are stacked and restored if necessary.
*
*      evalp also differs from evalx in that if the result is
*      an expression it is reevaluated. this occurs repeatedly.
*
*      to support optimization of pos and rpos, evalp uses wc
*      to signal the caller for the case of a simple vrblk
*      that is not an expression and is not trapped.  because
*      this case cannot have any side effects, optimization is
*      possible.

*
*      this variable is saved on the stack on encountering a
*      grouping and restored at the end of the grouping.
*

*
*      the following conditions must be met at the time when
*      gbcol is called.
*
*      1)   all pointers to blocks in the dynamic area must be
*           accessible to the garbage collector. this means
*           that they must occur in one of the following.
*
*           a)               main stack, with current top
*                            element being indicated by xs
*
*           b)               in relocatable fields of vrblks.
*
*           c)               in register xl at the time of call
*
*           e)               in the special region of working
*                            storage where names begin with r$.
*
*      2)   all pointers must point to the start of blocks with
*           the sole exception of the contents of the code
*           pointer register which points into the r$cod block.
*
*      3)   no location which appears to contain a pointer
*           into the dynamic region may occur unless it is in
*           fact a pointer to the start of the block. however
*           pointers outside this area may occur and will
*           not be changed by the garbage collector.
*           it is especially important to make sure that xl
*           does not contain a garbage value from some process
*           carried out before the call to the collector.
*
*      gbcol has the capability of moving the final compacted
*      result up in memory (with addresses adjusted accordingly)
*      this is used to add space to the static region. the
*      entry value of wb is the number of bytes to move up.
*      the caller must guarantee that there is enough room.
*      furthermore the value in wb if it is non-zero, must be at
*      least 256 so that the mwb instruction conditions are met.
       ejc

*      gbcol (continued)
*
*      the algorithm, which is a modification of the lisp-2
*      garbage collector devised by r.dewar and k.belcher
*      takes three passes as follows.
*
*      1)   all pointers in memory are scanned and blocks in use
*           determined from this scan. note that this procedure
*           is recursive and uses the main stack for linkage.
*           the marking process is thus similar to that used in
*           a standard lisp collector. however the method of
*           actually marking the blocks is different.
*
*           the first field of a block normally contains a
*           code entry point pointer. such an entry pointer
*           can be distinguished from the address of any pointer
*           to be processed by the collector. during garbage
*           collection, this word is used to build a back chain
*           of pointers through fields which point to the block.
*           the end of the chain is marked by the occurence
*           of the word which used to be in the first word of
*           the block. this backchain serves both as a mark
*           indicating that the block is in use and as a list of
*           references for the relocation phase.
*
*      2)   storage is scanned sequentially to discover which
*           blocks are currently in use as indicated by the
*           presence of a backchain. two pointers are maintained
*           one scans through looking at each block. the other
*           is incremented only for blocks found to be in use.
*           in this way, the eventual location of each block can
*           be determined without actually moving any blocks.
*           as each block which is in use is processed, the back
*           chain is used to reset all pointers which point to
*           this block to contain its new address, i.e. the
*           address it will occupy after the blocks are moved.
*           the first word of the block, taken from the end of
*           the chain is restored at this point.
*
*           during pass 2, the collector builds blocks which
*           describe the regions of storage which are to be
*           moved in the third pass. there is one descriptor for
*           each contiguous set of good blocks. the descriptor
*           is built just behind the block to be moved and
*           contains a pointer to the next block and the number
*           of words to be moved.
*
*      3)   in the third and final pass, the move descriptor
*           blocks built in pass two are used to actually move
*           the blocks down to the bottom of the dynamic region.
*           the collection is then complete and the next
*           available location pointer is reset.
       ejc

*      gbcol (continued)
*
.if    .csed
*      the garbage collector also recognizes the concept of
*      sediment.  sediment is defined as long-lived objects
*      which percipitate to the bottom of dynamic storage.
*      moving these objects during repeated collections is
*      inefficient.  it also contributes to thrashing on
*      systems with virtual memory.  in a typical worst-case
*      situation, there may be several megabytes of live objects
*      in the sediment, and only a few dead objects in need of
*      collection.  without recognising sediment, the standard
*      collector would move those megabytes of objects downward
*      to squeeze out the dead objects.  this type of move
*      would result in excessive thrasing for very little memory
*      gain.
*
*      scanning of blocks in the sediment cannot be avoided
*      entirely, because these blocks may contain pointers to
*      live objects above the sediment.  however, sediment
*      blocks need not be linked to a back chain as described
*      in pass one above.  since these blocks will not be moved,
*      pointers to them do not need to be adjusted.  eliminating
*      unnecessary back chain links increases locality of
*      reference, improving virtual memory performance.
*
*      because back chains are used to mark blocks whose con-
*      tents have been processed, a different marking system
.if    .cepp
*      is needed for blocks in the sediment.  since block type
*      words point to odd-parity entry addresses, merely incre-
*      menting the type word serves to mark the block as pro-
*      cessed.  during pass three, the type words are decre-
*      mented to restore them to their original value.
.else
*      is needed for blocks in the sediment.  all block type
*      words normally lie in the range b$aaa to p$yyy.  blocks
*      can be marked by adding an offset (created in gbcmk) to
*      move type words out of this range.  during pass three the
*      offset is subtracted to restore them to their original
*      value.

*
*      the variable dnams contains the number of bytes of memory
*      currently in the sediment.  setting dnams to zero will
*      eliminate the sediment and force it to be included in a
*      full garbage collection.  gbcol returns a suggested new
*      value for dnams (usually dnamp-dnamb) in xr which the
*      caller can store in dnams if it wishes to maintain the
*      sediment.  that is, data remaining after a garbage
*      collection is considered to be sediment.  if one accepts
*      the common lore that most objects are either very short-
*      or very long-lived, then this naive setting of dnams
*      probably includes some short-lived objects toward the end
*      of the sediment.
*
*      knowing when to reset dnams to zero to collect the sedi-
*      ment is not precisely known.  we force it to zero prior
*      to producing a dump, when gbcol is invoked by collect()
*      (so that the sediment is invisible to the user), when
*      sysmm is unable to obtain additional memory, and when
*      gbcol is called to relocate the dynamic area up in memory
*      (to make room for enlarging the static area).  if there
*      are no other reset situations, this leads to the inexo-
*      rable growth of the sediment, possible forcing a modest
*      program to begin to use virtual memory that it otherwise
*      would not.
*
*      as we scan sediment blocks in pass three, we maintain
*      aggregate counts of the amount of dead and live storage,
*      which is used to decide when to reset dnams.  when the
*      ratio of free storage found in the sediment to total
*      sediment size exceeds a threshold, the sediment is marked
*      for collection on the next gbcol call.

*
*      to concatenate two patterns, all successors in the left
*      pattern which point to the nothen node must be changed to
*      point to the right pattern. however, this modification
*      must be performed on a copy of the left argument rather
*      than the left argument itself, since the left argument
*      may be pointed to by some other variable value.
*
*      accordingly, it is necessary to copy the left argument.
*      this is not a trivial process since we must avoid copying
*      nodes more than once and the pattern is a graph structure
*      the following algorithm is employed.
*
*      the stack is used to store a list of nodes which
*      have already been copied. the format of the entries on
*      this list consists of a two word block. the first word
*      is the old address and the second word is the address
*      of the copy. this list is searched by the pcopy
*      routine to avoid making duplicate copies. a trick is
*      used to accomplish the concatenation at the same time.
*      a special entry is made to start with on the stack. this
*      entry records that the nothen node has been copied
*      already and the address of its copy is the right pattern.
*      this automatically performs the correct replacements.

*      sorta -- sort array
*
*      routine to sort an array or table on same basis as in
*      sitbol. a table is converted to an array, leaving two
*      dimensional arrays and vectors as cases to be considered.
*      whole rows of arrays are permuted according to the
*      ordering of the keys they contain, and the stride
*      referred to, is the the length of a row. it is one
*      for a vector.
*      the sort used is heapsort, fundamentals of data structure
*      horowitz and sahni, pitman 1977, page 347.
*      it is an order n*log(n) algorithm. in order
*      to make it stable, comparands may not compare equal. this
*      is achieved by sorting a copy array (referred to as the
*      sort array) containing at its high address end, byte
*      offsets to the rows to be sorted held in the original
*      array (referred to as the key array). sortc, the
*      comparison routine, accesses the keys through these
*      offsets and in the case of equality, resolves it by
*      comparing the offsets themselves. the sort permutes the
*      offsets which are then used in a final operation to copy
*      the actual items into the new array in sorted order.
*      references to zeroth item are to notional item
*      preceding first actual item.
*      reverse sorting for rsort is done by having the less than
*      test for keys effectively be replaced by a
*      greater than test.

*      the action taken on an error is as follows.
*
*      if errlimit keyword is zero, an abort is signalled,
*      see coding for system label abort at l$abo.
*
*      otherwise, errlimit is decremented and an errtype trace
*      generated if required. control returns either via a jump
*      to continue (to take the failure exit) or a specified
*      setexit trap is executed and control passes to the trap.
*      if 3 or more fatal errors occur an abort is signalled
*      regardless of errlimit and setexit - looping is all too
*      probable otherwise. fatal errors include stack overflow
*      and exceeding stlimit.
