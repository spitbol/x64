;      spitbol conditional assembly symbols for use by token.spt
;      ---------------------------------------------------------
;
;      this file of conditional symbols will override the conditional
;      definitions contained in the spitbol minimal file.   in addition,
;      lines beginning with ">" are treated as spitbol statements and
;      immediately executed.
;
;      for linux spitbol-x86
;
;      in the spitbol translator, the following conditional
;      assembly symbols are referred to. to incorporate the
;      features referred to, the minimal source should be
;      prefaced by suitable conditional assembly symbol
;      definitions.
;      in all cases it is permissible to default the definitions
;      in which case the additional features will be omitted
;      from the target code.
